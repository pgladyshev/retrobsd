       This  program is	intended for people wishing to sharpen their skills at
       Boggle (TM Parker Bros.).  If you invoke	the program with  4  arguments
       of  4  letters  each,  (_e_._g_.  "bbooggggllee aappppll eeppiiee mmootthh eerrhhdd") the program
       forms  the  obvious  Boggle  grid  and  lists  all   the	  words	  from
       //uussrr//ddiicctt//wwoorrddss	found therein. If you invoke the program without argu-
       ments, it will generate a board for you,	let you	enter words for	3 min-
       utes, and then tell you how well	you did	relative to //uussrr//ddiicctt//wwoorrddss.

       The  object  of	Boggle	is to find, within 3 minutes, as many words as
       possible	in a 4 by 4 grid of letters. Words  may	 be  formed  from  any
       sequence	 of  3	or  more adjacent letters in the grid. The letters may
       join horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  However, no position  in
       the grid	may be used more than once within any one word.	In competitive
       play amongst humans, each player	is given credit	for those of his words
       which no	other player has found.

       In  interactive	play,  enter  your words separated by spaces, tabs, or
       newlines. A bell	will ring when there is	2:00, 1:00, 0:10, 0:02,	 0:01,
       and  0:00 time left. You	may complete any word started before the expi-
       ration of time. You can surrender before	time is	up by hitting 'break'.
       While entering words, your erase	character is only effective within the
       current word and	your line kill character is ignored.

       Advanced	players	may wish to invoke the program with 1 or 2 +'s as  the
       first  argument.	The first + removes the	restriction that positions can
       only be used once in each word. The second + causes a  position	to  be
       considered adjacent to itself as	well as	its (up	to) 8 neighbors.
