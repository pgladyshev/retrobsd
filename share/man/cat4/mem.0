       _M_e_m  is	a special file that is an image	of the main memory of the com-
       puter.  It may be used, for example, to examine (and even to patch) the
       system.

       Byte  addresses	in  _m_e_m	 are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
       References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.

       The file	_k_m_e_m is	the same as _m_e_m	 except	 that  kernel  virtual	memory
       rather than physical memory is accessed.	 Only kernel virtual addresses
       that are	mapped to memory are allowed.  Examining and  patching	device
       registers  is  likely  to  lead to unexpected results when read-only or
       write-only bits are present.

       On PDP-11s, the I/O page	begins at location 0160000  of	_k_m_e_m  and  the
       per-process  data segment for the current process begins	at 0140000 and
       is USIZE	clicks (64 bytes each) long.

BBUUGGSS
       On PDP-11's, specifying an odd kernel or	user address, or an odd	trans-
       fer count is [generally]	slower than using all even parameters.

       On  machines  with ENABLE/34(tm)	memory mapping boards the I/O page can
       be accessed only	through	_k_m_e_m.
