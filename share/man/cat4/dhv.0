       A DHV-11	provides 8 communication lines.

       Each  line attached to the DHV-11 communications	multiplexer behaves as
       described in _t_t_y(4).  Input and output for each line may	 independently
       be  set to run at any of	13 speeds (50 and 200 baud are not available).
       While 38400 is available	the underlying hardware	is not fast enough  to
       handle it and there will	be pauses/gaps between characters.

       Bit  _0_2_0_0  of  the  minor device	number for DHV lines may be set	to say
       that a line is not properly connected, and  that	 the  line  should  be
       treated	as  hard-wired with carrier always present.  Thus creating the
       special character device	node "4, 130" via _m_k_n_o_d	 _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_S_2  _c	_4  _1_3_0
       would  cause line ttyS2 to be treated in	this way.  Turning on bit 6 in
       the minor device	number via _m_k_n_o_d  _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_S_2  _c	 _4  _1_9_4	 would	enable
       RTS/CTS flow control.

       The  DHV-11  has	 an  input  silo  but  does  nnoott have the programmable
       receiver	delay that the DHU (and	DHQ) have.  Thus system	services  more
       interrupts (i.e.	gets fewer characters per interrupt on average)	with a
       DHV-11 than with	a DHQ (in DHU mode).

       ddhhvv%%dd,,%%dd	NNXXMM.  No response from QBUS on a DMA transfer within a timeout
       period.	This error has never been observed on a	PDP-11 and is a	carry-
       over from the VAX driver	when that was ported to	2BSD.

       ddhhvv%%dd ddiiaagg %%oo.  Diagnostic information from the DHV11.  This has	 never
       been  observed.	 The DHV-11 hardware manual will be required to	decode
       the value printed out.

       ddhhvv%%dd:: %%dd oovveerrrruunnss.  The	character  input  silo	overflowed  before  it
       could  be  serviced.   This  message  is	 printed only when the line is
       closed.	By only	printing this when the line  is	 closed	 further  silo
       overruns	 are  avoided  (kernel	printf	statements  are	 not interrupt
       driven).

NNOOTTEESS
       The DHV lacks the receiver delay	that the DHU (and DHQ) have.  Thus  it
       is extremely easy (indeed it's almost certain at	higher data rates) for
       a DHV-11	to enter an interrupt per character mode and use 70-80%	of the
       cpu.
