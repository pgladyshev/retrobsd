       The  _c_s_s	device provides	a Local	Host/Distant Host interface to an IMP.
       It is normally used when	participating in the DARPA Internet.  The con-
       troller	itself	is  not	 accessible to users, but instead provides the
       hardware	support	to the IMP interface described in _i_m_p(4).   When  con-
       figuring, the _i_m_p(_N_I_M_P) pseudo-device is	also included.

       the device did not autoconfigure.  This is indicates a system problem.

       ccssss%%dd:: ccaann''tt iinniittiiaalliizzee.	 Insufficient UNIBUS resources existed to ini-
       tialize	the device.  This is likely to occur when the device is	run on
       a buffered data path on an 11/750 and other network interfaces are also
       configured  to use buffered data	paths, or when it is configured	to use
       buffered	data paths on an 11/730	(which has none).

       ize  the	 device, but the IMP failed to respond after 500 tries.	 Check
       the cabling.

       output had previously been started.

       sending data on output.

       data on input.

       ccssss%%dd::  bbaadd  lleennggtthh==%%dd.	An input operation resulted in a data transfer
       of less than 0 or more than 1008	bytes of data into  memory  (according
       to  the	word count register).  This should never happen	as the maximum
       size of a host-IMP message is 1008 bytes.
