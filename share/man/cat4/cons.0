       cons - PDP-11 console interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  console  is	 available to the processor through the	console	regis-
       ters.  It acts like a normal terminal, except that typing control-P  on
       the  consoles  of  some PDP-11's	puts the console in local console mode
       with an ODT (console debugger mode) prompt.  The	operation of the  con-
       sole in this mode varies	per-processor.	See the	PDP-11 Processor Hand-
       book for	your particular	processor.

       On an 11/44 the console can be put into local mode by typing a control-
       P.   The	ODT prompt is ``>>>''.	The processor is not stopped by	enter-
       ing local console mode.	The CPU	may be halted with the	``halt''  com-
       mand,  which  may  be  abbreviated to ``h.'' Conversational mode	is re-
       entered by using	the command ``c'' (continue).

       On 11/73	the processor's	front panel halt switch	must be	pressed	to put
       the  console into ODT mode.  The	ODT prompt is an ``@''.	 No characters
       typed on	the console are	special	while UNIX is in control of  the  con-
       sole.
