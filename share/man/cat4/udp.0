       UDP  is a simple, unreliable datagram protocol which is used to support
       the SOCK_DGRAM abstraction for the Internet protocol family.  UDP sock-
       ets  are	 connectionless,  and  are  normally  used with	the _s_e_n_d_t_o and
       _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m	calls, though the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t(2) call may also be used to fix  the
       destination  for	 future	 packets (in which case	the _r_e_c_v(2) or _r_e_a_d(2)
       and _s_e_n_d(2) or _w_r_i_t_e_(_2_) system calls may	be used).

       UDP address formats are identical to those used by TCP.	In  particular
       UDP  provides  a	 port  identifier  in  addition	to the normal Internet
       address format.	Note that the UDP port space is	separate from the  TCP
       port  space (i.e. a UDP port may	not be "connected" to a	TCP port).  In
       addition	broadcast packets may be sent (assuming	the underlying network
       supports	this) by using a reserved "broadcast address"; this address is
       network interface dependent.

       Options at the IP transport level may be	used with UDP; see _i_p(4P).

       A socket	operation may fail with	one of the following errors returned:

       [EISCONN]      when trying to establish a connection on a socket	 which
		      already  has one,	or when	trying to send a datagram with
		      the destination address  specified  and  the  socket  is
		      already connected;

       [ENOTCONN]     when  trying  to	send  a	 datagram,  but	no destination
		      address is specified, and	the socket  hasn't  been  con-
		      nected;

       [ENOBUFS]      when  the	system runs out	of memory for an internal data
		      structure;

       [EADDRINUSE]   when an attempt is made to create	a socket with  a  port
		      which has	already	been allocated;

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		      when  an	attempt	is made	to create a socket with	a net-
		      work address for which no	network	interface exists.
