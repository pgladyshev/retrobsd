       ARP  is	a  protocol used to dynamically	map between DARPA Internet and
       10Mb/s Ethernet addresses.  It is  used	by  all	 the  10Mb/s  Ethernet
       interface  drivers.   It	 is  not  specific to Internet protocols or to
       10Mb/s Ethernet,	but this implementation	currently supports  only  that
       combination.

       ARP  caches  Internet-Ethernet  address	mappings.   When  an interface
       requests	a mapping for an address not in	the cache, ARP queues the mes-
       sage which requires the mapping and broadcasts a	message	on the associ-
       ated network requesting the address mapping.  If	 a  response  is  pro-
       vided,  the  new	mapping	is cached and any pending message is transmit-
       ted.  ARP will queue at most one	packet while  waiting  for  a  mapping
       request	to  be	responded  to;	only the most recently ``transmitted''
       packet is kept.

       To facilitate communications with systems which do not use ARP,	_i_o_c_t_ls
       are  provided  to  enter	and delete entries in the Internet-to-Ethernet
       tables.	Usage:

	    iiooccttll((ss,, SSIIOOCCSSAARRPP,, ((ccaaddddrr__tt))&&aarrpprreeqq));;

       Each ioctl takes	the same structure as an argument.  SIOCSARP  sets  an
       ARP  entry,  SIOCGARP  gets  an	ARP entry, and SIOCDARP	deletes	an ARP
       entry.  These ioctls may	be applied to any  socket  descriptor  _s_,  but
       only by the super-user.	The _a_r_p_r_e_q structure contains:

	      /*
	       * ARP ioctl request
	       */
	      struct arpreq {
		       struct sockaddr	arp_pa;	 /* protocol address */
		       struct sockaddr	arp_ha;	 /* hardware address */
		       int		arp_flags;/* flags */
	      };
	      /*  arp_flags field values */
	      #define ATF_COM			 0x02/*	completed entry	(arp_ha	valid) */
	      #define  ATF_PERM		0x04	 /* permanent entry */
	      #define  ATF_PUBL		0x08	 /* publish (respond for other host) */
	      #define  ATF_USETRAILERS	0x10	 /* send trailer packets to host */

       The  address  family  for  the _a_r_p___p_a sockaddr must be AF_INET; for the
       _a_r_p___h_a sockaddr it must be AF_UNSPEC.  The only flag bits which may  be
       written	are  ATF_PERM,	ATF_PUBL and ATF_USETRAILERS.  ATF_PERM	causes
       the entry to be permanent if the	ioctl  call  succeeds.	 The  peculiar
       nature  of  the	ARP  tables may	cause the ioctl	to fail	if more	than 8
       (permanent) Internet host addresses hash	to the	same  slot.   ATF_PUBL
       specifies  that	the  ARP  code	should respond to ARP requests for the
       indicated host coming from other	machines.  This	allows a host  to  act
       as  an  ``ARP  server,''	 which may be useful in	convincing an ARP-only
       machine to talk to a non-ARP machine.

       ARP is also used	to negotiate the use  of  trailer  IP  encapsulations;
       trailers	 are an	alternate encapsulation	used to	allow efficient	packet
       alignment for large  packets  despite  variable-sized  headers.	 Hosts
       which  wish  to	receive	 trailer encapsulations	so indicate by sending
       gratuitous ARP translation replies along	with replies to	 IP  requests;
       they are	also sent in reply to IP translation replies.  The negotiation
       is thus fully symmetrical, in that either or  both  hosts  may  request
       trailers.   The	ATF_USETRAILERS	 flag is used to record	the receipt of
       such a reply, and enables the transmission of trailer packets  to  that
       host.

       ARP  watches  passively	for hosts impersonating	the local host (i.e. a
       host which responds to an ARP mapping  request  for  the	 local	host's
       address).

       ARP has discovered another host on the local network which responds  to
       mapping requests	for its	own Internet address.

       ARP  packets  on	 the  Ethernet use only	42 bytes of data; however, the
       smallest	legal Ethernet packet is 60 bytes (not including  CRC).	  Some
       systems may not enforce the minimum packet size,	others will.
