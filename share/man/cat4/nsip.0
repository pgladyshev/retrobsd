       The _n_s_i_p	interface is a software	mechanism which	may be used to	trans-
       mit  Xerox NS(tm) packets through otherwise uncooperative networks.  It
       functions by prepending an  IP  header,	and  resubmitting  the	packet
       through the unix	IP machinery.

       The  super-user can advise the operating	system of a willing partner by
       naming an IP address to be associated with an NS	 address.   Presently,
       only specific hosts pairs are allowed, and for each host	pair, an arti-
       ficial point-to-point interface is constructed.	At some	 future	 date,
       IP  broadcast  addresses	 or  hosts  may	 be paired with	NS networks or
       hosts.

       Specifically, a socket option of	SO_NSIP_ROUTE is set on	 a  socket  of
       family AF_NS, type SOCK_DGRAM, passing the following structure:

       struct nsip_req {
	    struct sockaddr rq_ns;   /*	must be	ns format destination */
	    struct sockaddr rq_ip;   /*	must be	ip format gateway */
	    short rq_flags;
       };

       addresses formatted in an unsuitable address  family;  the  packet  was
       dropped.

       It  is  absurd to have a	separate pseudo-device for each	pt-to-pt link.
       There is	no way to change the IP	address	for an NS host	once  the  the
       encapsulation  interface	 is set	up.  The request should	honor flags of
       RTF_GATEWAY to indicate remote networks,	 and  the  absence  of	RTF_UP
       should be a clue	to remove that partner.	 This was intended to postpone
       the necessity of	rewriting reverse ARP for the eenn device, and to	 allow
       passing	XNS  packets  through an Arpanet-Milnet	gateway, to facilitate
       testing between some co-operating universities.
