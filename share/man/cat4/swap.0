       swap - swap device

       This file refers	to the swap device in use by the system.  It should be
       linked to the special file for the disk or disk partition on which  the
       system  swaps.	It is used by programs that wish to read from the swap
       device without knowing its real name.   The  script  _/_d_e_v_/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V_._l_o_c_a_l
       normally	is edited by the system	builder	to set _/_d_e_v_/_s_w_a_p up correctly.
