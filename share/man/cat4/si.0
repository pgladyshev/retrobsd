       Files  with  minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
       of drive	0; minor devices 8 through 15 refer  to	 drive	1,  etc.   The
       standard	 device	 names	begin with ``si'' followed by the drive	number
       and then	a letter a-h for partitions 0-7	respectively.  The character ?
       stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.

       The block files access the disk via the system's	normal buffering mech-
       anism and may be	read and  written  without  regard  to	physical  disk
       records.	  There	 is  also  a `raw' interface which provides for	direct
       transmission between the	disk and the user's read or write  buffer.   A
       single  read  or	 write	call  results in exactly one I/O operation and
       therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient	when  many  words  are
       transmitted.   The  names of the	raw files conventionally begin with an
       extra `r.'

       In raw I/O the buffer must begin	on a word (even) boundary, and	counts
       should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).  Likewise _s_e_e_k calls
       should specify a	multiple of 512	bytes.

       The origin and size (in sectors)	of the pseudo-disks on each drive  are
       as follows:

       SI 9500/CDC9766 partitions:
	    disk   start  length       cyls  comments
	    xp?a       0    9120    0 -	 14  /
	    xp?b    9120    9120   15 -	 29  swap
	    xp?c   18240  234080   30 -	414
	    xp?d  252320  247906  415 -	822*
	    xp?e   18240  164160   30 -	299  /usr
	    xp?f  182400  152000  300 -	549
	    xp?g  334400  165826  550 -	822*
	    xp?h       0  500384    0 -	822  whole pack

       Those partitions	marked with an asterisk	(``*'')	actually stop short of
       the indicated ending cylinder  to  protect  any	bad  block  forwarding
       information  on	the packs.  The	indicated lengths are correct.	Parti-
       tion ``h'' must be used to access the bad block forwarding area.	 NN..BB..::
       the  _s_i	driver	does  not  support  bad	block forwarding; the space is
       reserved	in the event bad block forwarding is ever added	to the driver.

       In  raw	I/O  _r_e_a_d and _w_r_i_t_e(2) truncate	file offsets to	512-byte block
       boundaries, and _w_r_i_t_e scribbles	on  the	 tail  of  incomplete  blocks.
       Thus,  in  programs  that are likely to access raw devices, _r_e_a_d_, _w_r_i_t_e
       and _l_s_e_e_k(2) should always deal in 512-byte multiples.

       The partition tables for	the file systems should	be read	 off  of  each
       pack,  as  they are never quite what any	single installation would pre-
       fer, and	this would make	packs more portable.
