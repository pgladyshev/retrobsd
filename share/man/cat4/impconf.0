       The  _i_m_p	interface, as described	in BBN Report 1822, provides access to
       an intelligent message processor	normally used  when  participating  in
       the Department of Defense ARPA network.	The network interface communi-
       cates through a device controller, usually an ACC LH/DH or HDH or a DEC
       IMP-11A,	 with  the  IMP.   The	interface is "reliable"	and "flow-con-
       trolled"	by the host-IMP	protocol.

       To configure IMP	support, at least one of _a_c_c(4), _c_s_s(4)	or _h_d_h(4) must
       be  included.  The _c_o_u_n_t	specifies the total number of IMP connections.
       The network number on which the interface resides is specified at  boot
       time  using  the	 SIOCSIFADDR  ioctl.   The  host  number is discovered
       through receipt of NOOP messages	from the IMP.

       The network interface is	always in one of four states: up,  down,  ini-
       tializing,  or going down.  When	the system is booted, the interface is
       marked down.  If	the hardware controller	is  successfully  probed,  the
       interface  enters  the initializing state and transmits three NOOP mes-
       sages to	the IMP.  It then waits	for the	IMP to	respond	 with  two  or
       more NOOP messages in reply.  When it receives these messages it	enters
       the up state.  The ``going down'' state is entered only	when  notified
       by  the	IMP of an impending shutdown.  Packets may be sent through the
       interface only while it is in  the  up  state.	Outgoing  packets  are
       dropped with the	error ENETDOWN returned	to the caller if the interface
       is in any other state.

       ing  autoconfiguration  because too few IMP pseudo-devices were config-
       ured.

       iimmpp%%dd:: lleeaaddeerr eerrrroorr.  The IMP reported an error in a leader (1822  mes-
       sage  header).	This  causes the interface to be reset and any packets
       queued up for transmission to be	purged.

       (NCC)  is  manipulating	the  IMP.   By	convention  these messages are
       reported	to all hosts on	an IMP.

       iimmpp??:: hhoosstt %%xx,, lloosstt %%dd rrffnnmmss.  The IMP had messages outstanding to  the
       host  listed,  but  no  RFNM  (Request  for Next	Message) messages were
       received	from the IMP in	127 seconds.  The software state for that host
       is reinitialized.

       iimmpp%%dd::  iinntteerrffaaccee rreesseett.	 The host has received an interface reset mes-
       sage from the IMP.

       sage  which  caused it to reset its notion of its current address.  The
       Internet	address	is printed in hexadecimal, with	the host and IMP  num-
       bers  following.	  This	indicates  that	 the address originally	set by
       _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g(8) was incorrect, that the IMP has undergone an	identity  cri-
       sis,  or	 that communication between the	IMP and	the host is being gar-
       bled.

       iimmpp%%dd:: ddaattaa eerrrroorr.  The IMP noted an error in  data  transmitted.   The
       host-IMP	 interface is reset and	the host enters	the init state (await-
       ing NOOP	messages).

       iimmpp%%dd:: iinntteerrffaaccee	rreesseett.	The reset process has been completed.

       iimmpp%%dd:: mmaarrkkeedd ddoowwnn.  After receiving a "going down in 30	seconds"  mes-
       sage,  and waiting 30 seconds, the host has marked the IMP unavailable.
       Before packets may be sent to the IMP again, the	IMP  must  notify  the
       host, through a series of NOOP messages,	that it	is back	up.

       iimmpp%%dd::  ccaann''tt  hhaannddllee  aaff%%dd.   The  interface was handed	a message with
       addresses formatting in an unsuitable address family;  the  packet  was
       dropped.
