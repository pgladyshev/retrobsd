       This  line  discipline  provides	 a replacement for the old and new tty
       drivers described in _t_t_y(4) when	high speed output  to  and  especially
       input  from  another  machine  is to be transmitted over	a asynchronous
       communications line.  The discipline was	designed for use by the	Berke-
       ley  network.   It may be suitable for uploading	of data	from micropro-
       cessors into the	system.	 If you	are going to send data over  asynchro-
       nous  communications  lines at high speed into the system, you must use
       this discipline,	as the system otherwise	may  detect  high  input  data
       rates  on  terminal  lines and disables the lines; in any case the pro-
       cessing of such data when normal	terminal mechanisms are	involved satu-
       rates the system.

       The line	discipline is enabled by a sequence:

	    ##iinncclluuddee <<ssggttttyy..hh>>
	    iinntt	llddiisscc ==	NNEETTLLDDIISSCC,, ffiillddeess;; ......
	    iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, TTIIOOCCSSEETTDD,, &&llddiisscc));;

       A  typical  application program then reads a sequence of	lines from the
       terminal	port, checking header and sequencing information on each  line
       and  acknowledging  receipt of each line	to the sender, who then	trans-
       mits another line of data.  Typically several hundred bytes of data and
       a  smaller amount of control information	will be	received on each hand-
       shake.

       The old standard	teletype discipline can	be restored by doing:

	    llddiisscc == OOTTTTYYDDIISSCC;;
	    iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, TTIIOOCCSSEETTDD,, &&llddiisscc));;

       While in	networked mode,	normal teletype	output functions  take	place.
       Thus,  if an 8 bit output data path is desired, it is necessary to pre-
       pare the	output line by putting it into RAW mode	using _i_o_c_t_l(2).	  This
       must  be	 done  bbeeffoorree  changing	 the discipline	with TIOCSETD, as most
       _i_o_c_t_l(2)	calls are disabled while in network line-discipline mode.

       When in network mode, input processing is very limited to reduce	 over-
       head.   Currently  the input path is only 7 bits	wide, with newline the
       only recognized character, terminating an  input	 record.   Each	 input
       record  must  be	read and acknowledged before the next input is read as
       the system refuses to accept any	new data when there is a record	in the
       buffer.	 The buffer is limited in length, but the system guarantees to
       always be willing to accept input resulting in 512 data characters  and
       then the	terminating newline.

       User  level  programs  should  provide  sequencing and checksums	on the
       information to guarantee	accurate data transfer.

       The Purdue uploading line discipline, which provides 8  bits  and  uses
       timeout's  to terminate uploading should	be incorporated	into the stan-
       dard system, as it is much more	suitable  for  microprocessor  connec-
       tions.
