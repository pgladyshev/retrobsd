       The  _l_o_o_p  interface is a software loopback mechanism which may be used
       for performance analysis, software testing, and/or local	communication.
       As with other network interfaces, the loopback interface	must have net-
       work addresses assigned for each	address	family with which it is	to  be
       used.   These  addresses	 may  be  set  or changed with the SIOCSIFADDR
       ioctl.  The loopback interface should be	the last interface configured,
       as  protocols  may  use	the order of configuration as an indication of
       priority.  The loopback should nneevveerr  be	 configured  first  unless  no
       hardware	interfaces exist.

       dropped.

       Previous	versions of the	system enabled the loopback interface automat-
       ically, using a nonstandard Internet  address  (127.1).	 Use  of  that
       address	is now discouraged; a reserved host address for	the local net-
       work should be used instead.
