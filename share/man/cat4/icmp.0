       ICMP  is	 the  error  and  control  message protocol used by IP and the
       Internet	protocol family.  It may be accessed through  a	 "raw  socket"
       for  network  monitoring	and diagnostic functions.  The _p_r_o_t_o parameter
       to the socket call to create an ICMP socket is obtained from  _g_e_t_p_r_o_t_o_-
       _b_y_n_a_m_e(3N).   ICMP  sockets  are	 connectionless, and are normally used
       with the	_s_e_n_d_t_o and _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m calls, though the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t(2) call may also
       be  used	 to  fix the destination for future packets (in	which case the
       _r_e_a_d(2) or _r_e_c_v(2) and _w_r_i_t_e(2) or _s_e_n_d(2) system calls may be used).

       Outgoing	packets	automatically have an  IP  header  prepended  to  them
       (based on the destination address).  Incoming packets are received with
       the IP header and options intact.

       A socket	operation may fail with	one of the following errors returned:

       [EISCONN]      when trying to establish a connection on a socket	 which
		      already  has one,	or when	trying to send a datagram with
		      the destination address  specified  and  the  socket  is
		      already connected;

       [ENOTCONN]     when  trying  to	send  a	 datagram,  but	no destination
		      address is specified, and	the socket  hasn't  been  con-
		      nected;

       [ENOBUFS]      when  the	system runs out	of memory for an internal data
		      structure;

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		      when an attempt is made to create	a socket with  a  net-
		      work address for which no	network	interface exists.
