       The  NS	protocol  family is a collection of protocols layered atop the
       _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t	_D_a_t_a_g_r_a_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l (IDP)	transport layer, and using  the	 Xerox
       NS  address  formats.   The NS family provides protocol support for the
       SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM,	SOCK_SEQPACKET,	and SOCK_RAW socket types; the
       SOCK_RAW	interface is a debugging tool, allowing	you to trace all pack-
       ets entering, (or with toggling kernel variable,	additionally  leaving)
       the local host.

       NS  addresses  are  12  byte quantities,	consisting of a	4 byte Network
       number, a 6 byte	Host number and	a 2 byte port number,  all  stored  in
       network standard	format.	 (on the VAX these are word and	byte reversed;
       on the Sun they are  not	 reversed).   The  include  file  <_n_e_t_n_s_/_n_s_._h>
       defines	the  NS	 address as a structure	containing unions (for quicker
       comparisons).

       Sockets in the Internet protocol	family use  the	 following  addressing
       structure:

       struct sockaddr_ns {
	    short	   sns_family;
	    struct ns_addr sns_addr;
	    char      sns_zero[2];
       };

       where an	ns_addr	is composed as follows:

       union ns_host {
	    u_char	   c_host[6];
	    u_short	   s_host[3];
       };

       union ns_net {
	    u_char	   c_net[4];
	    u_short	   s_net[2];
       };

       struct ns_addr {
	    union ns_net   x_net;
	    union ns_host  x_host;
	    u_short   x_port;
       };

       Sockets	may be created with an address of all zeroes to	effect ``wild-
       card'' matching on incoming messages.  The local	port address specified
       in  a  _b_i_n_d(2)  call  is	 restricted to be greater than NSPORT_RESERVED
       (=3000, in <netns/ns.h>)	unless the creating process is running as  the
       super-user, providing a space of	protected port numbers.

PPRROOTTOOCCOOLLSS
       The  NS	protocol family	supported by the operating system is comprised
       of the Internet Datagram	Protocol (IDP) _i_d_p(4P),	Error Protocol (avail-
       able through IDP), and Sequenced	Packet Protocol	(SPP) _s_p_p(4P).

       SPP  is used to support the SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET abstraction,
       while IDP is used to support the	 SOCK_DGRAM  abstraction.   The	 Error
       protocol	 is  responded to by the kernel	to handle and report errors in
       protocol	processing; it is, however, only accessible to	user  programs
       through heroic actions.
