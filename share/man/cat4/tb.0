       This  line  discipline provides a polled	interface to many common digi-
       tizing devices which are	connected to a host  through  a	 serial	 line.
       When  these devices stream data at high speed, the use of the line dis-
       cipline is critical in minimizing the number of samples that would oth-
       erwise be lost due to buffer exhaustion in the _t_t_y(4) handler.

       The line	discipline is enabled by a sequence:

	    ##iinncclluuddee <<ssyyss//ttaabblleett..hh>>
	    iinntt	llddiisscc ==	TTBBLLDDIISSCC,, ffiillddeess;; ......
	    iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, TTIIOOCCSSEETTDD,, &&llddiisscc));;

       A typical application program then polls	the digitizing device by read-
       ing a binary data structure which contains: the current X and  Y	 posi-
       tions  (in  the device coordinate space), up-down status	of the buttons
       or pen stylus, proximity	information (when available), and a  count  of
       the  number  of	samples	 received  from	 the input device since	it was
       opened.	In addition, devices such as the GTCO append tilt and pressure
       information to the end of the aforementioned structure.	For the	Polhe-
       mus 3-D digitizer the structure read is completely different. Refer  to
       the include file	for a complete description.

       While  in  tablet mode, normal teletype input and output	functions take
       place.  Thus, if	an 8 bit output	data path is desired, it is  necessary
       to  prepare the output line by putting it into RAW mode using _i_o_c_t_l(2).
       This must be done bbeeffoorree	changing the discipline	with TIOCSETD, as most
       _i_o_c_t_l(2)	calls are disabled while in tablet line-discipline mode.

       The line	discipline supports _i_o_c_t_l(2) requests to get/set the operating
       mode, and to get/set the	tablet type and	operating mode by  _o_r-ing  the
       two values together.

       The  line  discipline  supports digitizing devices which	are compatible
       with Hitachi, GTCO, or Polhemus protocol	formats.   For	Hitachi	 there
       are  several  formats  with  that used in the newer model HDG-1111B the
       most common.
