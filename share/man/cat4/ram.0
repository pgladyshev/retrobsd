       The _r_a_m pseudo-device provides a	very fast extended memory store.  It's
       use is intended for file	systems	like _/_t_m_p and applications which  need
       to access a reasonably large amount of data quickly.

       The  amount  of memory dedicated	to the ram device is controlled	by the
       NRAM definition in units	of 512-byte blocks.  This is also patchable in
       the  system binary through the variable _r_a_m___s_i_z_e	(though	a patched sys-
       tem would have to be  rebooted  before  any  change  took  effect;  see
       _a_d_b(1)).	  This makes it	easy to	test the effects of different ram disk
       sizes on	system performance.  It's important to	note  that  any	 space
       given  to  the ram device is permanently	allocated at system boot time.
       Dedicating too much memory can adversely	affect system  performance  by
       forcing the system to swap heavily as in	a memory poor environment.

       The  block file accesses	the ram	disk via the system's buffering	mecha-
       nism through a buffer sharing arrangement with the  buffer  cache.   It
       may be read and written without regard to physical disk records.	 There
       is no `raw' interface since no speed advantage is  gained  by  such  an
       interface with the ram disk.

       The _r_a_m driver does not support pseudo-disks (partitions).  The special
       files refer to the entire `drive' as a  single  sequentially  addressed
       file.

       A typical use for the ram disk would be to mount	_/_t_m_p on	it.  Note that
       if this arrangement is recorded in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b then _/_e_t_c_/_r_c will have to
       be  modified  slightly to do a _m_k_f_s(8) on the ram disk bbeeffoorree the stan-
       dard file system	checks are done.
