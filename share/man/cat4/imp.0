       The  raw	imp socket provides direct access to the _i_m_p(4)	network	inter-
       face.  Users send packets  through  the	interface  using  the  _s_e_n_d(2)
       calls, and receive packets with the _r_e_c_v(2), calls.  All	outgoing pack-
       ets must	have an	1822 96-bit leader on the  front.   Likewise,  packets
       received	 by  the  user	will  have this	leader on the front.  The 1822
       leader and the legal values for the various fields are defined  in  the
       include	file  <_n_e_t_i_m_p_/_i_f___i_m_p_._h>.   The raw imp interface automatically
       installs	the length and destination address in the 1822 leader  of  all
       outgoing	packets; these need not	be filled in by	the user.

       If  the	protocol selected, _p_r_o_t_o, is zero, the socket will receive all
       IMP messages except RFNM	and incompletes	which are not input data for a
       kernel protocol.	 If _p_r_o_t_o is non-zero, only messages for the specified
       link type will be received.

       An operation on a socket	may fail with one of the following errors:

       [EISCONN]      when trying to establish a connection on a socket	 which
		      already  has one,	or when	trying to send a datagram with
		      the destination address  specified  and  the  socket  is
		      already connected;

       [ENOTCONN]     when  trying  to	send  a	 datagram,  but	no destination
		      address is specified, and	the socket  hasn't  been  con-
		      nected;

       [ENOBUFS]      when  the	system runs out	of memory for an internal data
		      structure;

       [ENOBUFS]      eight messages to	the destination	host are  outstanding,
		      and another eight	are already queued for output;

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		      when  an	attempt	is made	to create a socket with	a net-
		      work address for which no	network	interface exists.
