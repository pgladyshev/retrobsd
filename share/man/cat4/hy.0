       The  _h_y	interface  provides  access  to	 a Network Systems Corporation
       Hyperchannel Adapter.

       The network to which the	interface is attached  is  specified  at  boot
       time  with  an  SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The host's address is discovered by
       reading the adapter status register.  The interface will	 not  transmit
       or receive packets until	the network number is known.

       If the adapter does not respond to the  status  command	issued	during
       autoconfigure,  the  adapter  is	assumed	down.  A reboot	is required to
       recognize it.

       The adapter power fail interrupt	seems to occur sporadically when power
       has,  in	 fact,	not  failed.   The  driver will	believe	that power has
       failed only if it can not reset the power fail latch after a  ``reason-
       able''  time  interval.	 These seem to appear about 2-4	times a	day on
       some machines.  There seems to  be  no  correlation  with  adapter  rev
       level,  number  of ports	used etc. and whether a	machine	will get these
       ``bogus powerfails''.  They don't seem to cause any  real  problems  so
       they have been ignored.
