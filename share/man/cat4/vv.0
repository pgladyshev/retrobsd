       The  _v_v interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Proteon proNET ring net-
       work.

       The network address of the interface must be specified with an an SIOC-
       SIFADDR	ioctl  before data can be transmitted or received.  It is only
       permissible to change the network address while the interface is	marked
       "down".

       The  host's  hardware address is	discovered by putting the interface in
       digital loopback	mode (not joining the ring) and	 sending  a  broadcast
       packet from which the hardware address is extracted.

       Transmit	timeouts are detected through use of a watchdog	routine.  Lost
       input interrupts	are checked for	when packets are sent out.

       If the installation is running CTL boards which use the	old  broadcast
       address	of 0 instead of	the new	address	of 0xff, the define OLD_BROAD-
       CAST should be specified	in the driver.

       The driver can use ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize	 copying  data
       on  input  and output.  This may	be disabled, on	a per-interface	basis,
       by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

       The  encapsulation  of  trailer	packets	 in the	4.2BSD version of this
       driver was incorrect (the packet	type was in VAX	 byte  order).	 As  a
       result,	the  trailer  encapsulation  in	this version is	not compatible
       with the	4.2BSD VAX version.
