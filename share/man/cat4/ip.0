       IP  is  the transport layer protocol used by the	Internet protocol fam-
       ily.  Options may be set	at the IP level	when using higher-level	proto-
       cols  that  are	based  on  IP  (such  as TCP and UDP).	It may also be
       accessed	through	a "raw socket" when developing new protocols, or  spe-
       cial purpose applications.

       A  single generic option	is supported at	the IP level, IP_OPTIONS, that
       may be used to provide IP options to be transmitted in the IP header of
       each  outgoing packet.  Options are set with _s_e_t_s_o_c_k_o_p_t(2) and examined
       with _g_e_t_s_o_c_k_o_p_t(2).  The	format of IP options to	be sent	is that	speci-
       fied  by	the IP protocol	specification, with one	exception: the list of
       addresses for Source Route options must include the  first-hop  gateway
       at  the	beginning  of  the  list  of  gateways.	 The first-hop gateway
       address will be extracted from the option list and  the	size  adjusted
       accordingly before use.	IP options may be used with any	socket type in
       the Internet family.

       Raw IP sockets are connectionless,  and	are  normally  used  with  the
       _s_e_n_d_t_o  and _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m calls, though the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t(2) call may also be used
       to fix the destination for future packets (in which case	the _r_e_a_d(2) or
       _r_e_c_v(2) and _w_r_i_t_e(2) or _s_e_n_d(2) system calls may	be used).

       If  _p_r_o_t_o  is  0, the default protocol IPPROTO_RAW is used for outgoing
       packets,	and only incoming  packets  destined  for  that	 protocol  are
       received.   If  _p_r_o_t_o is	non-zero, that protocol	number will be used on
       outgoing	packets	and to filter incoming packets.

       Outgoing	packets	automatically have an  IP  header  prepended  to  them
       (based on the destination address and the protocol number the socket is
       created with).  Incoming	 packets  are  received	 with  IP  header  and
       options intact.

       A socket	operation may fail with	one of the following errors returned:

       [EISCONN]      when  trying to establish	a connection on	a socket which
		      already has one, or when trying to send a	datagram  with
		      the  destination	address	 specified  and	 the socket is
		      already connected;

       [ENOTCONN]     when trying to  send  a  datagram,  but  no  destination
		      address  is  specified,  and the socket hasn't been con-
		      nected;

       [ENOBUFS]      when the system runs out of memory for an	internal  data
		      structure;

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		      when  an	attempt	is made	to create a socket with	a net-
		      work address for which no	network	interface exists.

       The following errors specific to	IP may occur when setting  or  getting
       IP options:

       [EINVAL]	      An unknown socket	option name was	given.

       [EINVAL]	      The  IP  option  field  was improperly formed; an	option
		      field was	shorter	than the minimum value or longer  than
		      the option buffer	provided.
