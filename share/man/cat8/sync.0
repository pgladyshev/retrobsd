       _S_y_n_c  executes the _s_y_n_c system primitive.  _S_y_n_c can be called to	insure
       that all	disk writes have been completed	before the processor is	halted
       in  a  way not suitably done by _r_e_b_o_o_t(8) or _h_a_l_t(8).  Generally, it is
       preferable to use _r_e_b_o_o_t	or _h_a_l_t	to shut	down the system, as  they  may
       perform	additional  actions such as resynchronizing the	hardware clock
       and flushing internal caches before performing a	final _s_y_n_c.

       See _s_y_n_c(2) for details on the system primitive.
