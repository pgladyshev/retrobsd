       adduser - procedure for adding new users

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  new  user must choose	a login	name, which must not already appear in
       _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_dor _/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s.  It must also not  begin  with  the	hyphen
       (``-'')	character.   It	 is strongly recommended that it be all	lower-
       case, and not contain the dot (``.'') character,	as that	tends to  con-
       fuse  mailers.	An  account  can  be  added by editing a line into the
       passwd file; this must be done with the password	file  locked  e.g.  by
       using _c_h_p_a_s_s(1) or _v_i_p_w(8).

       A  new user is given a group and	user id.  Login's and user id's	should
       be unique across	the system, and	often across a group of	systems, since
       they are	used to	control	file access.  Typically, users working on sim-
       ilar projects will be put in the	same groups.   At  the	University  of
       California,  Berkeley, we have groups for system	staff, faculty,	gradu-
       ate students, and special groups	for large projects.

       A skeletal account for a	new user "ernie" might look like:

	      ernie::25:30::0:0:Ernie		  Kovacs,508		 Evans
	      Hall,x7925,642-8202:/a/users/ernie:/bin/csh

       For a description of each of these fields, see _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       It  is useful to	give new users some help in getting started, supplying
       them with a few skeletal	files such as _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e if they use  "/bin/sh",
       or _._c_s_h_r_c and _._l_o_g_i_n if they use	"/bin/csh".  The directory "/usr/skel"
       contains	skeletal definitions of	such files.  New users should be given
       copies of these files which, for	instance, use _t_s_e_t(1) automatically at
       each login.

       User information	should (and eventually will) be	stored elsewhere.
