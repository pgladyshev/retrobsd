       _U_u_s_n_a_p displays in tabular format a synopsis of the current UUCP	situa-
       tion.  The format of each line is as follows:

		 site	N Cmds	 N Data	  N Xqts   Message

       Where "site" is the name	of the site with work, "N" is a	count of  each
       of the three possible types of work (command, data, or remote execute),
       and "Message" is	the current status message for that site as  found  in
       the STST	file.

       Included	 in  "Message" may be the time left before UUCP	can re-try the
       call, and the count of the number of times that UUCP has	tried  (unsuc-
       cessfully) to reach the site.
