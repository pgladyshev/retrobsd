       _M_k_n_o_d  makes  a	special	 file.	 The first argument is the _n_a_m_e	of the
       entry.  The second is bb if the special file is block-type (disks, tape)
       or  cc  if it is character-type (other devices).	The last two arguments
       are numbers specifying the _m_a_j_o_r	device type and	the _m_i_n_o_r device (e.g.
       unit, drive, or line number).

       The  assignment	of  major  device  numbers is specific to each system.
       They have to be dug out of the system source file _c_o_n_f_._c_.
