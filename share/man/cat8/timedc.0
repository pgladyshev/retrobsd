       _T_i_m_e_d_c  is  used	to control the operation of the	_t_i_m_e_d program.	It may
       be used to:

       +o      measure the differences between machines'	clocks,

       +o      find the location	where the master time server is	running,

       +o      enable or	disable	tracing	of messages received by	_t_i_m_e_d, and

       +o      perform various debugging	actions.

       Without any arguments, _t_i_m_e_d_c will prompt for commands from  the	 stan-
       dard  input.   If  arguments  are supplied, _t_i_m_e_d_c interprets the first
       argument	as a command and the remaining arguments as parameters to  the
       command.	  The  standard	input may be redirected	causing	_t_i_m_e_d_c to read
       commands	from a file.  Commands may be abbreviated; recognized commands
       are:

       ? [ command ... ]

       help [ command ... ]
	      Print a short description	of each	command	specified in the argu-
	      ment list, or, if	no arguments are given,	a list of  the	recog-
	      nized commands.

       clockdiff host ...
	      Compute  the  differences	 between the clock of the host machine
	      and the clocks of	the machines given as arguments.

       trace { on | off	}
	      Enable or	disable	the tracing of incoming	messages to  _t_i_m_e_d  in
	      the file /usr/adm/timed.log.

       quit
	      Exit from	timedc.

       Other  commands may be included for use in testing and debugging	_t_i_m_e_d;
       the help	command	and the	program	source may be consulted	for details.
