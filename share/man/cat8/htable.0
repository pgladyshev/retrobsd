       _H_t_a_b_l_e  is used to convert host files in	the format specified in	Inter-
       net RFC 810 to the format used by the network library routines.	 Three
       files  are  created as a	result of running _h_t_a_b_l_e: _h_o_s_t_s, _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, and
       _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s.  The _h_o_s_t_s file may be	used by	the _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) routines
       in  mapping host	names to addresses if the nameserver, _n_a_m_e_d(8),	is not
       used.  The _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s file	is used	by the _g_e_t_n_e_t_e_n_t(3N) routines in  map-
       ping  network  names  to	numbers.  The _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s file may	be used	by the
       routing	daemon	in  identifying	 ``passive''  Internet	gateways;  see
       _r_o_u_t_e_d(8C) for an explanation.

       If  any	of  the	 files _l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t_s, _l_o_c_a_l_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, or _l_o_c_a_l_g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s are
       present in the current directory, the file's contents is	 prepended  to
       the  output  file.   Of	these,	only the gateways file is interpreted.
       This allows sites to maintain local aliases and entries which  are  not
       normally	present	in the master database.	 Only one gateway to each net-
       work will be placed in the gateways  file;  a  gateway  listed  in  the
       localgateways file will override	any in the input file.

       If  the	gateways  file	is to be used, a list of networks to which the
       host is directly	connected is specified with the	 --cc  flag.   The  net-
       works,  separated  by commas, may be given by name or in	Internet-stan-
       dard dot	notation,  e.g.	  --cc  arpanet,128.32,local-ether-net.	_H_t_a_b_l_e
       only  includes gateways which are directly connected to one of the net-
       works specified,	or which can be	reached	from another gateway on	a con-
       nected net.

       If  the	--ll option is given with	a list of networks (in the same	format
       as for --cc), these networks will be treated as ``local,''	 and  informa-
       tion  about  hosts  on local networks is	taken only from	the localhosts
       file.  Entries for local	hosts from the main database will be  omitted.
       This  allows  the localhosts file to completely override	any entries in
       the input file.

       _H_t_a_b_l_e is best used in conjunction with the _g_e_t_t_a_b_l_e(8C)	program	 which
       retrieves the NIC database from a host.

       If  the	name-domain  system provided network name mapping well as host
       name mapping, _h_t_a_b_l_e would no longer be needed.
