       _T_i_m_e_d  is  the  time server daemon and is normally invoked at boot time
       from the	_r_c(8) file.  It	synchronizes the host's	time with the time  of
       other  machines	in  a local area network running _t_i_m_e_d(8).  These time
       servers will slow down the clocks of some machines  and	speed  up  the
       clocks  of others to bring them to the average network time.  The aver-
       age network time	is computed from  measurements	of  clock  differences
       using the ICMP timestamp	request	message.

       The service provided by _t_i_m_e_d is	based  on a master-slave scheme.  When
       _t_i_m_e_d(8)	is started on a	machine, it asks the master  for  the  network
       time  and  sets	the host's clock to that time.	After that, it accepts
       synchronization messages	periodically sent by the master	and calls _a_d_j_-
       _t_i_m_e(2) to perform the needed corrections on the	host's clock.

       It  also	 communicates  with _d_a_t_e(1) in order to	set the	date globally,
       and with	_t_i_m_e_d_c(8), a timed control program.  If	 the  machine  running
       the  master crashes, then the slaves will elect a new master from among
       slaves running with the --MM flag.	 A _t_i_m_e_d running without the  --MM  flag
       will  remain  a slave.  The --tt flag enables _t_i_m_e_d to trace the messages
       it receives in the file /usr/adm/timed.log.  Tracing can	be  turned  on
       or  off	by  the	program	_t_i_m_e_d_c(8).  _T_i_m_e_d normally checks for a	master
       time server on each network to which it is connected, except  as	 modi-
       fied  by	 the options described below.  It will request synchronization
       service from the	first master server located.  If permitted by  the  --MM
       flag,  it will provide synchronization service on any attached networks
       on which	no current master server was detected.	Such a	server	propa-
       gates the time computed by the top-level	master.	 The --nn	flag, followed
       by the name of a	network	which the  host	 is  connected	to  (see  _n_e_t_-
       _w_o_r_k_s(5)),  overrides  the default choice of the	network	addresses made
       by the program.	Each time the --nn flag appears, that  network  name  is
       added  to  a  list  of valid networks.  All other networks are ignored.
       The --ii flag, followed by	the name of a network to  which	 the  host  is
       connected  (see	_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s(5)), overrides	the default choice of the net-
       work addresses made by the program.  Each time  the  --ii	flag  appears,
       that  network name is added to a	list of	networks to ignore.  All other
       networks	are used by the	time daemon.  The --nn and --ii flags are meaning-
       less if used together.
