       The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call	to prepare and graft a
       _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _d_e_v_i_c_e on to the	file system tree at the	point _n_o_d_e.  If	either
       _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appropriate information is	 taken
       from the	fstab(5) file.

       The  system  maintains a	list of	currently mounted file systems.	 If no
       arguments are given to mmoouunntt, this list is printed.

       The options are as follows:


       --aa	 Causes	everything to be done except  for  the	actual	system
		 call.	This option is useful in conjunction with the

       --vv	 flag to determine what	the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

       --ff	 Forces	 the  revocation  of write access when trying to down-
		 grade a filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.
		 For 2.11BSD this flag is currently not	implemented.

       --oo	 Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma sep-
		 arated	string of options.  The	following options  are	avail-
		 able:


		 async	   All	I/O  to	 the  file system should be done asyn-
			   chronously.

		 force	   The same as --ff;  forces  the	 revocation  of	 write
			   access  when	trying to downgrade a filesystem mount
			   status from read-write to read-only.	  This is  not
			   (and	likely never will be) supported	in 2.11BSD.

		 noaccesstime
			   File	access times are not updated.

			   nneewwss..

		 noauto	   This	filesystem should be skipped when mount	is run
			   with	the --aa flag.

		 na	   Same	as noauto.

		 nodev	   Do not interpret character or block special devices
			   on  the  file  system.  This	option is useful for a
			   server that has  file  systems  containing  special
			   devices for architectures other than	its own.

		 noexec	   Do  not  allow  execution  of  any  binaries	on the
			   mounted file	system.	 This option is	useful	for  a
			   server  that	 has  file systems containing binaries
			   for architectures other than	its own.

		 nosuid	   Do not allow	set-user-identifier or set-group-iden-
			   tifier bits to take effect.

		 rdonly	   The	same  as  --rr;  mount the file system read-only
			   (even the super-user	may not	write it).

		 sync	   All I/O to the file	system	should	be  done  syn-
			   chronously.

		 update	   The	same  as  --uu;  indicate	 that the status of an
			   already mounted file	system should be changed.

		 Any additional	options	specific to a filesystem type that  is
		 not one of the	internally known types (see the	--tt option) may
		 be passed as a	comma separated	list; these options  are  dis-
		 tinguished  by	a leading - (dash).  Options that take a value
		 are specified using the syntax	-option=value.	At present  no
		 2.11BSD mount options use the following form, the example has
		 been retained for illustrative	purposes only.	 For  example,
		 the mount command:

		 mount -t mfs -o nosuid,-N,-s=4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

		 causes	mmoouunntt to execute the equivalent	of:

		 /sbin/mount_mfs -o nosuid -N -s 4000 /dev/dk0b	/tmp

       --rr	 The  file  system is to be mounted read-only.	Mount the file
		 system	read-only (even	the super-user may not write it).  The
		 same as the ``rdonly''	argument to the	--oo option.

       --tt "_u_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e"
		 The  argument	following  the --tt is used to indicate the file
		 system	type.  The type	_u_f_s is the default.  _U_f_s is  also  the
		 only value supported by 2.11BSD other than _s_w_a_p.  Thus	the --tt
		 will rarely be	used.  The --tt option can be used  to  indicate
		 that  the  actions should only	be taken on filesystems	of the
		 specified type.  More than one	type may  be  specified	 in  a
		 comma	separated  list.   The list of filesystem types	can be
		 prefixed with ``no'' to  specify  the	filesystem  types  for
		 which	action	should	_n_o_t  be	taken.	For example, the mmoouunntt
		 command:

		 mount -a -t nonfs,mfs

		 mounts	all filesystems	except those of	type NFS and MFS.

		 If the	type is	not one	of the internally known	 types,	 mount
		 will  attempt	to  execute a program in _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___X_X_X where
		 _X_X_X is	replaced by the	type name.  For	example, mfs  filesys-
		 tems are mounted by the program _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___m_f_s.

       --uu	 The  --uu  flag indicates that the status of an already mounted
		 file system should be changed.	 Any of	the options  discussed
		 above	(the --oo	option)	may be changed;	also a file system can
		 be changed from read-only to read-write or  vice  versa.   An
		 attempt  to  change from read-write to	read-only will fail if
		 any files on the filesystem are currently  open  for  writing
		 unless	 the --ff	flag is	also specified.	 This is currently not
		 implemented in	2.11BSD.  The  ability	to  change  the	 flags
		 (nodev,  nosuid,  etc)	 is  however  supported.   The	set of
		 options is determined by first	extracting the options for the
		 file  system  from the	_f_s_t_a_b table, then applying any options
		 specified by the --oo argument, and finally applying the	--rr  or
		 --ww option.

       --vv	 Verbose mode.

       --ww	 The file system object	is to be read and write.

BBUUGGSS
       It is possible for a corrupted file system to cause a crash.

       mmoouunntt  and this manpage were ported from	4.4BSD-Lite to 2.11BSD to gain
       the ability to set the various flags such as nnooddeevv, nnoossuuiidd and  so  on.
       Multiple	 filesystem types are not supported and	several	of the options
       and flags are not implemented.
