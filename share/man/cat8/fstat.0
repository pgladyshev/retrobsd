       _F_s_t_a_t  identifies  open	files.	A file is considered open if a process
       has it open, if it is the working directory for a process, or if	it  is
       an  active  pure	text file.  If no options are specified, _f_s_t_a_t reports
       on all open files.

       Options:

       --uu    Report all	files open by a	specified user.

       --pp    Report all	files open by a	specified process id.

       ffiilleennaammee......
	     Restrict reports to the specified files.  If the file is a	 block
	     special  file,  _f_s_t_a_t  additionally  reports on any open files on
	     that device, treating it as a mounted file	system.

       The following fields are	printed

       UUSSEERR  The username of the owner of the process.

       CCMMDD   The command name of the process.

       PPIIDD   The process id.

       FFDD    The file number in	the per-process	open file table.  The  special
	     names  "text"  and	"wd" mean that the file	is the pure text inode
	     or	the working directory for the process.	If the file number  is
	     followed  by  an asterick (*), then the file is not an inode, but
	     either a socket, fifo, or has an error of some kind. In this case
	     the  rest	of the entry is	variable format, doesn't correspond to
	     the rest of the headings, and is enclosed	in  parenthesis.   The
	     following	paragraph describing sockets will explain the variable
	     format.

       DDEEVVIICCEE
	     Major minor number	of the device this file	exists on.

       IINNOODDEE The inode number of the file.

       SSIIZZEE  The size in bytes of the file.

       TTYYPPEE  The type of the file. (see	sys/file.h)

       Sockets

       The formating of	open sockets depends on	the protocol domain.   In  all
       cases  the  first  field	 is  the  domain name, the second field	is the
       socket type (stream, dgram, etc), and the third	is  the	 socket	 flags
       field (in hex).	The remaining fields are protocol dependent.  For tcp,
       it is the address of the	tcpcb, and for udp, the	 inpcb	(socket	 pcb).
       For  unix  domain  sockets,  its	 the address of	the socket pcb and the
       address of the connected	pcb (if	connected).   Otherwise	 the  protocol
       number and address of the socket	itself are printed. The	idea is	not to
       duplicate netstat, but to make available	enough information for further
       analysis.  For example, the addresses mentioned above are the addresses
       which the "netstat -A" command would print for tcp,  udp,  and  unixdo-
       main.   Note  that  since  pipe(2)  is implemented with sockets,	a pipe
       appears as a connected unix domain  stream  socket.   A	unidirectional
       unix  domain socket indicates the direction of flow with	an arrow ("<-"
       or "->"), and a full duplex socket shows	a double arrow ("<->").

BBUUGGSS
       Socket information clutters the output.

       Since _f_s_t_a_t takes a snapshot of the system, it is only  correct	for  a
       very short period of time.
