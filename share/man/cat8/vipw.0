       _V_i_p_w  edits  the	password file while setting the	appropriate locks, and
       does any	necessary processing after the password	file is	unlocked.   If
       the password file is already being edited, then you will	be told	to try
       again later.  The _v_i editor will	be used	unless the  environment	 vari-
       able EDITOR indicates an	alternate editor.

       _V_i_p_w  performs  a number	of consistency checks on the password entries,
       and will	not allow a password file  with	 a  ``mangled''	 entry	to  be
       installed.  If _v_i_p_w rejects the new password file, the user is prompted
       to re-enter the edit session.

       Once the	information has	been verified, _v_i_p_w uses _m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8) to	update
       the  user  database.  This is run in the	background, and, at very large
       sites could take	several	minutes.  Until	this update is completed,  the
       password	 file is unavailable for other updates and the new information
       will not	be available to	programs.
