       _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r	is a program to	automatically intercept	bug reports, summarize
       them and	store them in the appropriate  sub  directories	 of  the  mail
       directory  specified  on	 the  command  line  or	the (system dependent)
       default.	 It is designed	to be compatible with the Rand MH mail system.
       _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r	 is  normally  invoked	by  the	 mail delivery program through
       _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(5) with a line such as the following in /etc/aliases.

	    bugs:"|bugfiler /usr/bugs/mail"

       It reads	the message from the standard input or the named file,	checks
       the format and returns mail acknowledging receipt or a message indicat-
       ing the proper format.  Valid reports are then summarized and filed  in
       the  appropriate	 folder;  improperly formatted messages	are filed in a
       folder named ``errors.''	 Program maintainers can  then	log  onto  the
       system  and  check the summary file for bugs that pertain to them.  Bug
       reports should be submitted in RFC822 format and	 aremust  contain  the
       following header	lines to be properly indexed:

	    Date: <date	the report is received>
	    From: <valid return	address>
	    Subject: <short summary of the problem>
	    Index: <source directory>/<source file> <version> [Fix]

       In  addition,  the body of the message must contain a line which	begins
       with ``Description:'' followed by zero or  more	lines  describing  the
       problem	in detail and a	line beginning with ``Repeat-By:'' followed by
       zero or more lines describing how to repeat the problem.	 If  the  key-
       word  `Fix' is specified	in the `Index' line, then there	must also be a
       line beginning with ``Fix:'' followed by	a diff	of  the	 old  and  new
       source files or a description of	what was done to fix the problem.

       The  `Index' line is the	key to the filing mechanism. The source	direc-
       tory name must match one	of the folder names  in	 the  mail  directory.
       The  message  is	 then  filed in	this folder and	a line appended	to the
       summary file in the following format:

	    <folder name>/<message number>     <Index info>
				     <Subject info>

       The bug report may also be redistributed	according to  the  index.   If
       the  file  _m_a_i_l_d_i_r/.redist  exists, it is examined for a	line beginning
       with the	index name followed with a tab.	 The remainder	of  this  line
       contains	 a comma-separated list	of mail	addresses which	should receive
       copies of bugs with this	index.	The list may be	continued onto	multi-
       ple lines by ending each	but the	last with a backslash (`\').

       /usr/sbin/sendmail	mail delivery program
       /usr/libexec/unixtomh	converts unix mail format to mh	format
       maildir/.ack		the message sent in acknowledgement
       maildir/.format		the   message  sent  when  format  errors  are
       detected
       maildir/.redist		the redistribution list
       maildir/summary		the summary file
       maildir/Bf??????		temporary copy of the input message
       maildir/Rp??????		temporary file for the reply message.

BBUUGGSS
       Since mail can be forwarded in a	number	of  different  ways,  _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r
       does  not  recognize forwarded mail and will reply/complain to the for-
       warder instead of the original sender  unless  there  is	 a  `Reply-To'
       field in	the header.

       Duplicate  messages should be discarded or recognized and put somewhere
       else.
