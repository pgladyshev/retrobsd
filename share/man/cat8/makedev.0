       _M_A_K_E_D_E_V	is  a shell script normally used to install special files.  It
       resides in the _/_d_e_v directory, as this is the normal location  of  spe-
       cial  files.  Arguments to _M_A_K_E_D_E_V are usually of the form _d_e_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e?
       where _d_e_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e is one	of the supported devices listed	in  section  4
       of  the manual and ``?''	is a logical unit number (0-9).	 A few special
       arguments create	assorted collections of	devices	and are	listed below.

       ssttdd    Create the _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d devices for the system;  e.g.	 /dev/console,
	      /dev/tty.	  The  VAX-11/780  console floppy device, /dev/floppy,
	      and  VAX-11/750  and  VAX-11/730	console	 cassette   device(s),
	      /dev/tu?,	are also created with this entry.

       llooccaall  Create  those  devices specific to the local site.  This request
	      causes the shell file _/_d_e_v_/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V_._l_o_c_a_l to be  executed.	  Site
	      specific	commands,  such	as those used to setup dialup lines as
	      ``ttyd?''	should be included in this file.

       Since all devices are created using _m_k_n_o_d(8), this shell	script is use-
       ful only	to the super-user.

       Either  self-explanatory,  or  generated	 by one	of the programs	called
       from the	script.	 Use ``sh -x MAKEDEV'' in case of trouble.
