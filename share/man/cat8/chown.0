       _C_h_o_w_n changes the owner of the _f_i_l_e_s to _o_w_n_e_r.  The owner may be	either
       a decimal UID or	a login	name found in the password file.  An  optional
       group  may also be specified.  The group	may be either a	decimal	GID or
       a group name found in the group-ID file.

       Only the	super-user can change owner, in	order to  simplify  accounting
       procedures.   No	 errors	 are  reported	when  the --ff (force) option is
       given.

       When the	--RR option is given, _c_h_o_w_n recursively descends	its  directory
       arguments setting the specified owner.  When symbolic links are encoun-
       tered, their ownership is changed, but they are not traversed.
