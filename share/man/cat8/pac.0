       _P_a_c reads the printer/plotter accounting	files, accumulating the	number
       of  pages  (the	usual case) or feet (for raster	devices) of paper con-
       sumed by	each user, and printing	out how	much  each  user  consumed  in
       pages or	feet and dollars.  If any _n_a_m_e_s	are specified, then statistics
       are only	printed	for those users; usually, statistics are  printed  for
       every user who has used any paper.

       The  --PP	flag causes accounting to be done for the named	printer.  Nor-
       mally, accounting is done for the default printer (site	dependent)  or
       the value of the	environment variable PPRRIINNTTEERR is	used.

       The  --pp	flag causes the	value _p_r_i_c_e to be used for the cost in dollars
       instead of the  default	value  of  0.02	 or  the  price	 specified  in
       _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p_.

       The  --cc flag causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually the	output
       is sorted alphabetically	by name.

       The --rr flag reverses the	sorting	order.

       The --ss flag causes the accounting information to	be summarized  on  the
       summary	accounting  file;  this	 summarization is necessary since on a
       busy system, the	accounting file	can grow by several lines per day.

       The --mm flag causes the host name	to be ignored in the accounting	 file.
       This allows for a user on multiple machines to have all of his printing
       charges grouped together.

       unknown.
