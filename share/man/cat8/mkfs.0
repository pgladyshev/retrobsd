       NN..BB..:: file systems are normally created with the	_n_e_w_f_s(8) command.

       _M_k_f_s  constructs	 a file	system by writing on the special file _s_p_e_c_i_a_l.
       The size	of the filesystem in logical blocks is	specified  by  the  --ss
       _s_i_z_e option.  Logical blocks are	1K (2 sectors) under 2.11BSD.

	    NNOOTTEE::  The	nneewwffss(8)  program's  --ss	option is in units of sseeccttoorrss.
	    NNeewwffss(8) converts this to filesystem (logical) blocks for mmkkffss(8)..

       The number of inodes is calculated based	on the argument	_b_y_t_e_s  to  the
       --ii  option.   The  default  is  4096.   If more inodes are desired in a
       filesystem (there is an absolute	maximum	of 65500) then a  lower	 value
       for _b_y_t_e_s should	be used, perhaps 3072 or even 2048.

       The flags --mm _g_a_p	and --nn _m_o_d_u_l_u_s determine the block interleaving	of the
       freelist	that will be constructed, where	_g_a_p is	the  distance  between
       successive 1024-byte blocks, and	_m_o_d_u_l_u_s	is the number of blocks	before
       the pattern repeats, typically one cylinder.  The  optimal  values  for
       these  parameters vary with the speed and geometry of the disk, as well
       as the speed of the processor.  NNeewwffss(8)	 will  calculate  the  correct
       values in almost	all cases from the disklabel.

       The  _l_o_s_t_+_f_o_u_n_d	directory is created but the boot block	is left	unini-
       tialized	(see ddiisskkllaabbeell(8).)
