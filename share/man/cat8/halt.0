       2.11BSD	is started by placing it in memory at location zero and	trans-
       ferring to its entry point.  Since the system is	not reentrant,	it  is
       necessary  to  read  it in from disk or tape each time it is to be boot
       strapped.

       RReebboooottiinngg aa rruunnnniinngg ssyysstteemm:: When	the system is running and a reboot  is
       desired,	 _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(8) is	normally used to stop time sharing and put the
       system into single user mode.  If there are no users then  //ssbbiinn//rreebboooott
       can be used without shutting the	system down first.

       Reboot  normally	causes the disks to be synced and allows the system to
       perform other shutdown  activities  such	 as  resynchronizing  hardware
       time-of-day  clocks.   A	multi-user reboot (as described	below) is then
       initiated.  This	causes a system	to be booted  and  an  automatic  disk
       check to	be performed.  If all this succeeds without incident, the sys-
       tem is then brought up for multi-user operation.

       Options to reboot are:

       --ll     Don't try	to tell	_s_y_s_l_o_g_d(8) what's about	to happen.

       --qq     Reboot quickly and ungracefully, without shutting	 down  running
	      processes	first.

       --nn     Don't  sync before rebooting.  This can be used if a disk	or the
	      processor	is on fire.

       --hh     Don't reboot, simply halt	the processor.

       --dd     Dump memory onto the dump	device,	usually	part of	 swap,	before
	      rebooting.  The dump is done in the same way as after a panic.

       --aa     Have  the	 system	 booter	 ask  for the name of the system to be
	      booted, rather  than  immediately	 booting  the  default	system
	      (/unix).

       --rr     Mount the	root file system as _r_e_a_d _o_n_l_y when the system reboots.
	      This is not supported by the kernel in 2.11BSD.

       --ss     Don't enter multi-user mode after	system has rebooted - stay  in
	      single user mode.

       --ff     Fast  reboot.   Omit the automatic file system consistency check
	      when the system reboots and goes	multi-user.   This  is	accom-
	      plished  by  passing a _f_a_s_t _r_e_b_o_o_t flag on to the	rebooting ker-
	      nel.  This currently prevents the	use of --ff flag in  conjunction
	      with the --hh (halt) flag.

       --DD     Set  the	_a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g(8)  debug  flag.  This is normally not used
	      unless one is debugging the _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g program.

       --RR     Tells the	kernel to use the compiled in root  device.   Normally
	      the  system  uses	 the  device  from  which it was booted	as the
	      root/swap/pipe/dump device.

       _R_e_b_o_o_t normally places a	shutdown record	in the login  accounting  file
       /usr/adm/wtmp.	This is	inhibited if the --qq or --nn options are present.
       Note that the --ff	(fast reboot) and --nn (don't sync) options are  contra-
       dictory;	the request for	a fast reboot is ignored in this case.

       _H_a_l_t  and _f_a_s_t_b_o_o_t are synonymous with ``rreebboooott --hh'' and	``rreebboooott --ff'',
       respectively.

       PPoowweerr ffaaiill aanndd ccrraasshh rreeccoovveerryy:: Normally,	the system will	reboot	itself
       at  power-up or after crashes iiff	the contents of	low memory are intact.
       An automatic consistency	check of the file systems will	be  performed,
       and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user	operations.
