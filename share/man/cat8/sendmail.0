       _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l	sends a	message	to one or more _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_s, routing the message
       over whatever networks are necessary.  _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l does internetwork  for-
       warding as necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.

       _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l	 is  not  intended as a	user interface routine;	other programs
       provide user-friendly front ends; _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l is used only to deliver pre-
       formatted messages.

       With  no	 flags,	_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l reads its standard input up to	an end-of-file
       or a line consisting only of a single dot and sends a copy of the  mes-
       sage  found  there  to  all of the addresses listed.  It	determines the
       network(s) to use based on the syntax and contents of the addresses.

       Local addresses are looked up in	 a  file  and  aliased	appropriately.
       Aliasing	 can  be  prevented by preceding the address with a backslash.
       Normally	the sender is not included in any alias	expansions,  e.g.,  if
       `john'  sends to	`group', and `group' includes `john' in	the expansion,
       then the	letter will not	be delivered to	`john'.

       Flags are:

       --bbaa	   Go into ARPANET mode.  All input lines must end with	a  CR-
		   LF,	and all	messages will be generated with	a CR-LF	at the
		   end.	 Also, the ``From:'' and ``Sender:'' fields are	 exam-
		   ined	for the	name of	the sender.

       --bbdd	   Run	as  a  daemon.	 This requires Berkeley	IPC.  _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l
		   will	fork and run in	background listening on	socket 25  for
		   incoming  SMTP  connections.	  This	is  normally  run from
		   _/_e_t_c_/_r_c.

       --bbii	   Initialize the alias	database.

       --bbmm	   Deliver mail	in the usual way (default).

       --bbpp	   Print a listing of the queue.

       --bbss	   Use the SMTP	protocol as described in  RFC821  on  standard
		   input  and output.  This flag implies all the operations of
		   the --bbaa flag	that are compatible with SMTP.

       --bbtt	   Run in address test mode.  This mode	 reads	addresses  and
		   shows  the  steps in	parsing; it is used for	debugging con-
		   figuration tables.

       --bbvv	   Verify names	only - do not try to collect or	deliver	a mes-
		   sage.  Verify mode is normally used for validating users or
		   mailing lists.

       --bbzz	   Create the configuration freeze file.

       --CC_f_i_l_e	   Use alternate configuration file.  _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l refuses to  run
		   as  root  if	 an alternate configuration file is specified.
		   The frozen configuration file is bypassed.

       --dd_X	   Set debugging value to _X_.

       --FF_f_u_l_l_n_a_m_e  Set the full	name of	the sender.

       --ff_n_a_m_e	   Sets	the name of the	``from'' person	(i.e., the  sender  of
		   the	mail).	--ff can only be used by ``trusted'' users (nor-
		   mally _r_o_o_t_, _d_a_e_m_o_n_, and _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_) or if the person  you  are
		   trying to become is the same	as the person you are.

       --hh_N	   Set the hop count to	_N_.  The	hop count is incremented every
		   time	the mail is processed.	When it	reaches	a  limit,  the
		   mail	 is  returned  with an error message, the victim of an
		   aliasing loop.  If not specified,  ``Received:''  lines  in
		   the message are counted.

       --nn	   Don't do aliasing.

       --oo_x_v_a_l_u_e	   Set option _x	to the specified _v_a_l_u_e_.	 Options are described
		   below.

       --qq[[_t_i_m_e]]	   Processed saved messages in the queue at  given  intervals.
		   If  _t_i_m_e is omitted,	process	the queue once.	 _T_i_m_e is given
		   as a	tagged number, with `s'	being seconds, `m' being  min-
		   utes, `h' being hours, `d' being days, and `w' being	weeks.
		   For example,	``-q1h30m'' or ``-q90m'' would	both  set  the
		   timeout  to one hour	thirty minutes.	 If _t_i_m_e is specified,
		   _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l will run in	background.  This option can  be  used
		   safely with --bbdd.

       --rr_n_a_m_e	   An alternate	and obsolete form of the --ff flag.

       --tt	   Read	message	for recipients.	 To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines will
		   be scanned for recipient addresses.	The Bcc: line will  be
		   deleted before transmission.	 Any addresses in the argument
		   list	will be	suppressed, that is,  they  will  _n_o_t  receive
		   copies even if listed in the	message	header.

       --vv	   Go  into verbose mode.  Alias expansions will be announced,
		   etc.

       There are also a	number of processing options that may  be  set.	  Nor-
       mally  these  will only be used by a system administrator.  Options may
       be set either on	the command line using the --oo flag or in the  configu-
       ration  file.   These are described in detail in	the _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_-
       _t_i_o_n _a_n_d	_O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e_.  The options are:

       A_f_i_l_e	   Use alternate alias file.

       c	   On mailers that are considered ``expensive''	to connect to,
		   don't  initiate immediate connection.  This requires	queue-
		   ing.

       d_x	   Set the delivery mode to _x_.	Delivery  modes	 are  `i'  for
		   interactive	(synchronous)  delivery,  `b'  for  background
		   (asynchronous) delivery, and	`q' for	 queue	only  -	 i.e.,
		   actual delivery is done the next time the queue is run.

       D	   Try	to  automatically rebuild the alias database if	neces-
		   sary.

       e_x	   Set error processing	to mode	_x_.  Valid  modes  are  `m'  to
		   mail	 back  the  error  message,  `w' to ``write'' back the
		   error message (or mail it back if the sender	is not	logged
		   in),	`p' to print the errors	on the terminal	(default), `q'
		   to  throw  away  error  messages  (only  exit   status   is
		   returned),  and  `e'	 to  do	 special  processing  for  the
		   BerkNet.  If	the text of the	message	is not mailed back  by
		   modes  `m'  or  `w'	and  if	 the  sender  is local to this
		   machine, a copy of the message  is  appended	 to  the  file
		   ``dead.letter'' in the sender's home	directory.

       F_m_o_d_e	   The mode to use when	creating temporary files.

       f	   Save	UNIX-style From	lines at the front of messages.

       g_N	   The default group id	to use when calling mailers.

       H_f_i_l_e	   The SMTP help file.

       i	   Do  not take	dots on	a line by themselves as	a message ter-
		   minator.

       L_n	   The log level.

       m	   Send	to ``me'' (the sender) also if I am in an alias	expan-
		   sion.

       o	   If  set,  this  message may have old	style headers.	If not
		   set,	this message is	guaranteed to have new	style  headers
		   (i.e.,  commas  instead  of	spaces between addresses).  If
		   set,	an adaptive algorithm  is  used	 that  will  correctly
		   determine the header	format in most cases.

       Q_q_u_e_u_e_d_i_r   Select the directory	in which to queue messages.

       r_t_i_m_e_o_u_t	   The	timeout	 on  reads; if none is set, _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l will wait
		   forever for a mailer.  This option violates	the  word  (if
		   not the intent) of the SMTP specification, show the timeout
		   should probably be fairly large.

       S_f_i_l_e	   Save	statistics in the named	file.

       s	   Always instantiate the queue	file, even under circumstances
		   where  it  is not strictly necessary.  This provides	safety
		   against system crashes during delivery.

       T_t_i_m_e	   Set the timeout on undelivered messages in the queue	to the
		   specified  time.   After delivery has failed	(e.g., because
		   of a	host being down) for this amount of time, failed  mes-
		   sages will be returned to the sender.  The default is three
		   days.

       t_s_t_z_,_d_t_z	   Set the name	of the time zone.

       u_N	   Set the default user	id for mailers.

       In aliases, the first character of a name may  be  a  vertical  bar  to
       cause  interpretation  of the rest of the name as a command to pipe the
       mail to.	 It may	be necessary to	quote the name to keep	_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l  from
       suppressing  the	 blanks	from between arguments.	 For example, a	common
       alias is:

	    msgs: "|/usr/ucb/msgs -s"

       Aliases may also	have the syntax	``:include:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e'' to ask  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l
       to read the named file for a list of recipients.	 For example, an alias
       such as:

	    poets: ":include:/usr/local/lib/poets.list"

       would read _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_l_i_b_/_p_o_e_t_s_._l_i_s_t for	the list of  addresses	making
       up the group.

       _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l	 returns an exit status	describing what	it did.	 The codes are
       defined in <_s_y_s_e_x_i_t_s_._h>
	  EX_OK		   Successful completion on all	addresses.
	  EX_NOUSER	   User	name not recognized.
	  EX_UNAVAILABLE   Catchall  meaning  necessary	 resources  were   not
			   available.
	  EX_SYNTAX	   Syntax error	in address.
	  EX_SOFTWARE	   Internal software error, including bad arguments.
	  EX_OSERR	   Temporary  operating	 system	error, such as "cannot
			   fork".
	  EX_NOHOST	   Host	name not recognized.
	  EX_TEMPFAIL	   Message could not  be  sent	immediately,  but  was
			   queued.

       If invoked as _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s_e_s_, _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l will rebuild the alias database.  If
       invoked as _m_a_i_l_q_, _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l will print the contents of the mail queue.
