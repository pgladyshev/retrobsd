       _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d  is  invoked  at  boot	 time  to  manage the Xerox NS routing
       tables.	The NS routing daemon uses the Xerox  NS  Routing  Information
       Protocol	in maintaining up to date kernel routing table entries.

       In  normal operation _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d listens for routing information packets.
       If the host is connected	to multiple NS networks, it periodically  sup-
       plies  copies of	its routing tables to any directly connected hosts and
       networks.

       When _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d is started, it uses the SIOCGIFCONF _i_o_c_t_l	to find	 those
       directly	 connected  interfaces	configured  into the system and	marked
       ``up'' (the software  loopback  interface  is  ignored).	  If  multiple
       interfaces  are	present,  it  is assumed the host will forward packets
       between networks.  _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d then transmits a _r_e_q_u_e_s_t  packet  on  each
       interface  (using  a broadcast packet if	the interface supports it) and
       enters a	loop, listening	for _r_e_q_u_e_s_t and	_r_e_s_p_o_n_s_e  packets  from	 other
       hosts.

       When  a	_r_e_q_u_e_s_t	packet is received, _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d formulates a reply based
       on the information maintained in	its  internal  tables.	 The  _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_e
       packet  generated  contains  a list of known routes, each marked	with a
       ``hop count'' metric (a count of	16, or greater,	is considered  ``infi-
       nite'').	  The  metric  associated  with	each route returned provides a
       metric _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_e _t_o _t_h_e _s_e_n_d_e_r.

       _R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e	packets	received by _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d are used to update  the  routing
       tables if one of	the following conditions is satisfied:

       (1)    No  routing  table  entry	 exists	for the	destination network or
	      host, and	the metric indicates the destination is	 ``reachable''
	      (i.e. the	hop count is not infinite).

       (2)    The  source  host	of the packet is the same as the router	in the
	      existing routing table entry.  That is, updated  information  is
	      being  received  from the	very internetwork router through which
	      packets for the destination are being routed.

       (3)    The existing entry in the	routing	table has not been updated for
	      some  time  (defined to be 90 seconds) and the route is at least
	      as cost effective	as the current route.

       (4)    The new route describes a	shorter	route to the destination  than
	      the  one	currently  stored in the routing tables; the metric of
	      the new route is compared	against	the one	stored in the table to
	      decide this.

       When an update is applied, _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d records the	change in its internal
       tables and generates a _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_e packet to all directly connected	 hosts
       and  networks.	_R_o_u_t_e_d	waits  a short period of time (no more than 30
       seconds)	before modifying the kernel's routing tables to	allow possible
       unstable	situations to settle.

       In addition to processing incoming packets, _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d also periodically
       checks the routing table	entries.  If an	entry has not been updated for
       3  minutes,  the	entry's	metric is set to infinity and marked for dele-
       tion.  Deletions	are delayed an additional 60  seconds  to  insure  the
       invalidation is propagated to other routers.

       Hosts  acting as	internetwork routers gratuitously supply their routing
       tables every 30 seconds to all directly connected hosts and networks.

       Supplying the --ss	option forces _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d	to supply routing  information
       whether	it  is acting as an internetwork router	or not.	 The --qq	option
       is the opposite of the --ss option.  If the --tt option is  specified,  all
       packets	sent or	received are printed on	the standard output.  In addi-
       tion, _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d will not	divorce	itself from the	 controlling  terminal
       so  that	interrupts from	the keyboard will kill the process.  Any other
       argument	 supplied  is  interpreted  as	the  name  of  file  in	 which
       _X_N_S_r_o_u_t_e_d's  actions  should  be	logged.	 This log contains information
       about any changes to the	routing	tables and a history  of  recent  mes-
       sages sent and received which are related to the	changed	route.
