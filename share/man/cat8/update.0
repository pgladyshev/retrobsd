       _U_p_d_a_t_e  is  a program that executes the _s_y_n_c(2) primitive every 30 sec-
       onds.  This insures that	the file system	is fairly up to	date  in  case
       of  a  crash.  This command should not be executed directly, but	should
       be executed out of the initialization shell command file.

       With _u_p_d_a_t_e running, if the CPU is halted just as the _s_y_n_c is executed,
       a  file	system	can be damaged.	 This is partially due to DEC hardware
       that writes zeros when NPR requests fail.   A  fix  would  be  to  have
       _s_y_n_c(8) temporarily increment the system	time by	at least 30 seconds to
       trigger the execution of	_u_p_d_a_t_e_.	 This would give 30 seconds  grace  to
       halt the	CPU.
