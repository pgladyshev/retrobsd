       shutdown	- close	down the system	at a given time

       _S_h_u_t_d_o_w_n	provides an automated shutdown procedure  which	 a  super-user
       can use to notify users nicely when the system is shutting down,	saving
       them from system	administrators,	hackers, and gurus, who	 would	other-
       wise not	bother with niceties.

       _T_i_m_e  is	 the time at which _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n will bring the system down and may
       be the word nnooww (indicating an immediate	shutdown) or specify a	future
       time  in	 one  of  two  formats:	 ++number and hour::min.	The first form
       brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r	minutes	and the	second brings the sys-
       tem down	at the time of day indicated (as a 24-hour clock).

       At  intervals which get closer together as apocalypse approaches, warn-
       ing messages are	displayed at the terminals of all users	on the system.
       Five  minutes  before  shutdown,	 or immediately	if shutdown is in less
       than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by creating /etc/nologin and	 writ-
       ing  a  message there.  If this file exists when	a user attempts	to log
       in, _l_o_g_i_n(1) prints its contents	and exits.  The	file is	 removed  just
       before _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n exits.

       At shutdown time	a message is written in	the system log,	containing the
       time of shutdown, who ran shutdown and the reason.   Then  a  terminate
       signal  is  sent	to _i_n_i_t	to bring the system down to single-user	state.
       Alternatively, if --rr,, --hh,, or --kk	was  used,  then  _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n  will  exec
       _r_e_b_o_o_t(8),  _h_a_l_t(8),  or	avoid shutting the system down (respectively).
       (If it isn't obvious, --kk	is to make people _t_h_i_n_k	the  system  is	 going
       down!)

       With  the  --ff  option, _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n arranges, in the	manner of _f_a_s_t_b_o_o_t(8),
       that when the system is rebooted	the file systems will not be  checked.
       The --nn option prevents the normal _s_y_n_c(2) before	stopping.

       The  time  of  the  shutdown  and  the  warning	message	 are placed in
       /etc/nologin and	should be used to inform the users about when the sys-
       tem will	be back	up and why it is going down (or	anything else).

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/nologin   tells login not to let anyone log	in

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       login(1), reboot(8), fastboot(8)

BBUUGGSS
       Only allows you to kill the system between now and 23:59	if you use the
       absolute	time for shutdown.
