       fdisk  allows the inspection, deletion, creation	and activation of par-
       titions within a	RetroDisk device.  All operations are performed	on the
       block device for	a RetroDisk device, /dev/rdX.  An operation of -p, -d,
       -n or -a	and a device name must be provided:

       -p Display the current partition	table.

       -d Delete the partition specified as a number between 1 and 4

       -n Create a new partition.  The partition is placed after the last par-
       tition  already on the device (space permitting)	and is either the size
       specified as a number of	kilobytes, or it will fill the entire rest  of
       the  free  space	on the disk.  The optional flag	-w can be specified to
       wipe the	current	partition table	to create a new	one.

       -a Toggle the active flag on a partition.  The active flag is  used  at
       boot  time  to  decide which partition should be	booted from, and which
       should be used as swap.


DDEEVVIICCEESS
       The devices are always the  block  devices  for	the  RetroDisk	system
       (/dev/rdX).   Other  devices  will  appear to work, but fdisk will just
       write a master boot record regardless and  will	corrupt	 the  existing
       filesystem on the device.


BBUUGGSS
       There  is no protection on the system.  An MBR will attempt to be writ-
       ten to whatever device you specify regardless of	the device type.

       There are no warnings or	confirmations.	Things just happen.
