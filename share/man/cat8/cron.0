       _C_r_o_n  should  be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local.  It will return
       immediately, so you don't need to start it with '&'.

       _C_r_o_n searches /var/cron/tabs for crontab files which  are  named  after
       accounts  in  /etc/passwd; crontabs found are loaded into memory.  _C_r_o_n
       also searches for /etc/crontab which is  in  a  different  format  (see
       _c_r_o_n_t_a_b_(_5_)_)_.   _C_r_o_n  then  wakes  up every minute, examining all stored
       crontabs, checking each command to see if it should be run in the  cur‚Äê
       rent  minute.   When  executing  commands,  any output is mailed to the
       owner of the crontab (or to the user named in  the  MAILTO  environment
       variable in the crontab, if such exists).

       Additionally,  _c_r_o_n  checks each minute to see if its spool directory's
       modtime (or the modtime on _/_e_t_c_/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b_) has changed, and  if  it  has,
       _c_r_o_n  will  then  examine  the modtime on all crontabs and reload those
       which have changed.  Thus _c_r_o_n need not be restarted whenever a crontab
       file is modified.  Note that the _C_r_o_n_t_a_b(1) command updates the modtime
       of the spool directory whenever it changes a crontab.
