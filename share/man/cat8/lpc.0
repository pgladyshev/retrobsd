       _L_p_c is used by the system administrator to control the operation	of the
       line printer system.  For each line printer configured  in  /etc/print-
       cap, _l_p_c	may be used to:

       +o      disable or enable	a printer,

       +o      disable or enable	a printer's spooling queue,

       +o      rearrange	the order of jobs in a spooling	queue,

       +o      find  the	 status	 of  printers,	and  their associated spooling
	      queues and printer dameons.

       Without any arguments, _l_p_c will prompt for commands from	 the  standard
       input.  If arguments are	supplied, _l_p_c interprets the first argument as
       a command and the remaining arguments as	 parameters  to	 the  command.
       The  standard input may be redirected causing _l_p_c to read commands from
       file.  Commands may be abreviated; the following	is the list of	recog-
       nized commands.

       ? [ command ... ]

       help [ command ... ]
	      Print a short description	of each	command	specified in the argu-
	      ment list, or, if	no arguments are given,	a list of  the	recog-
	      nized commands.

       abort { all | printer ... }
	      Terminate	 an  active  spooling daemon on	the local host immedi-
	      ately and	then disable printing  (preventing  new	 daemons  from
	      being started by _l_p_r) for	the specified printers.

       clean { all | printer ... }
	      Remove  any  temporary files, data files,	and control files that
	      cannot be	printed	(i.e., do not form  a  complete	 printer  job)
	      from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.

       disable { all | printer ... }
	      Turn  the	 specified  printer  queues  off.   This  prevents new
	      printer jobs from	being entered into the queue by	_l_p_r.

       down { all | printer } message ...
	      Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing  and  put
	      _m_e_s_s_a_g_e  in the printer status file. The message doesn't need to
	      be quoted, the remaining arguments  are  treated	like  _e_c_h_o(1).
	      This is normally used to take a printer down and let others know
	      why (lpq will indicate the printer is down and print the	status
	      message).

       enable {	all | printer ... }
	      Enable  spooling	on  the	 local	queue for the listed printers.
	      This will	allow _l_p_r to put new jobs in the spool queue.

       exit

       quit
	      Exit from	lpc.

       restart { all | printer ... }
	      Attempt to start a new printer daemon.  This is useful when some
	      abnormal condition causes	the daemon to die unexpectedly leaving
	      jobs in the queue.  _L_p_q will report  that	 there	is  no	daemon
	      present  when  this condition occurs.  If	the user is the	super-
	      user, try	to abort the current  daemon  first  (i.e.,  kill  and
	      restart a	stuck daemon).

       start { all | printer ... }
	      Enable  printing	and  start  a  spooling	 daemon	for the	listed
	      printers.

       status {	all | printer ... }
	      Display the status of daemons and	queues on the local machine.

       stop { all | printer ...	}
	      Stop a spooling daemon after the current job completes and  dis-
	      able printing.

       topq printer [ jobnum ... ] [ user ... ]
	      Place  the  jobs	in  the	order listed at	the top	of the printer
	      queue.

       up { all	| printer ... }
	      Enable everything	and start a new	 printer  daemon.  Undoes  the
	      effects of _d_o_w_n.
