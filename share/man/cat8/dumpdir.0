       _D_u_m_p_d_i_r	is used	to read	magtapes dumped	with the _d_u_m_p command and list
       the names and inode numbers of all the files  and  directories  on  the
       tape.

       The  ff  option  causes  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e	as the name of the tape	instead	of the
       default.

       _5_1_2_d_u_m_p_d_i_r is a version of _d_u_m_p_d_i_r that can  read  tapes	 written  from
       512-byte	block file systems.

       If  the	dump extends over more than one	tape, it may ask you to	change
       tapes.  Reply with a newline when the next tape has been	mounted.

BBUUGGSS
       There is	redundant information on the tape that could be	used  in  case
       of  tape	reading	problems.  Unfortunately, _d_u_m_p_d_i_r and _5_1_2_d_u_m_p_d_i_r don't
       use it.
