       _R_c  is  the  command  script  which  controls  the automatic reboot and
       _r_c_._l_o_c_a_l	is the script holding commands which are pertinent only	 to  a
       specific	site.

       When  an	 automatic reboot is in	progress, _r_c is	invoked	with the argu-
       ment _a_u_t_o_b_o_o_t and runs a	_f_s_c_k with option --pp to ``preen'' all the disks
       of minor	inconsistencies	resulting from the last	system shutdown	and to
       check for serious inconsistencies caused	by hardware or software	 fail-
       ure.   If  this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the	second part of
       _r_c is run.

       The second part of _r_c_, which is run after a  auto-reboot	 succeeds  and
       also  if	 _r_c  is	 invoked  when	a  single  user	 shell terminates (see
       _i_n_i_t(8)), starts	all the	daemons	on the system, preserves editor	 files
       and  clears  the	 scratch directory //ttmmpp..  _R_c_._l_o_c_a_l is executed immedi-
       ately before any	other commands after a successful _f_s_c_k.	 Normally, the
       first  commands	placed in the _r_c_._l_o_c_a_l file define the machine's name,
       using _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(1), and save any possible	core  image  that  might  have
       been  generated as a result of a	system crash, _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e(8).  The	latter
       command is included in the _r_c_._l_o_c_a_l file	because	the directory in which
       core dumps are saved is usually site specific.
