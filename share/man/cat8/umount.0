       The  uummoouunntt command calls the umount(2) system call to remove a _s_p_e_c_i_a_l
       _d_e_v_i_c_e from the file system tree	at the point _n_o_d_e.  If either  _s_p_e_c_i_a_l
       or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appropriate information is	taken from the
       fstab(5)	file.

       The options are as follows:


       --aa	 All of	the file systems described in fstab(5) are unmounted.

       --ff	 The  file  system  is	forcibly  unmounted.   Active  special
		 devices  continue  to work, but all other files return	errors
		 if further accesses are attempted.  The root file system can-
		 not be	forcibly unmounted.  This is not currently implemented
		 in 2.11BSD.

       --tt _u_f_s |	_e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
		 Is used to indicate the  actions  should  only	 be  taken  on
		 filesystems of	the specified type.  More than one type	may be
		 specified in a	comma separated	list.  The list	of  filesystem
		 types can be prefixed with nnoo to specify the filesystem types
		 for which action should  nnoott  be  taken.   For	 example,  the
		 uummoouunntt	command:

		 umount	-a -t nfs,mfs

		 umounts all filesystems of the	type NFS and MFS.

		 NNOOTTEE:	Only  UFS is supported by 2.11BSD.  The	example	is for
		 illustrative purposes only.

       --vv	 Verbose, additional information is printed out	as  each  file
		 system	is unmounted.
