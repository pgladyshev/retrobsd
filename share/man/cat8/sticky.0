       sticky -	persistent text	and append-only	directories

       The  _s_t_i_c_k_y _b_i_t (file mode bit 01000, see _c_h_m_o_d(2)) is used to indicate
       special treatment for certain executable	files and directories.

       While the `sticky bit' is set on	a sharable executable file,  the  text
       of  that	 file will not be removed from the system swap area.  Thus the
       file does not have to be	fetched	from the file system upon each	execu-
       tion.   Shareable  text	segments  are  normally	placed in a least-fre-
       quently-used cache after	use, and thus  the  `sticky  bit'  has	little
       effect on commonly-used text images.

       Sharable	executable files are made by the --nn and	--zz options of _l_d(1).

       Only  the  super-user  can  set the sticky bit on a sharable executable
       file.

       A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an	append-only directory,
       or,  more  accurately,  a  directory  in	which the deletion of files is
       restricted.  A file in a	 sticky	 directory  may	 only  be  removed  or
       renamed	by  a  user if the user	has write permission for the directory
       and the user is the owner of the	file, the owner	of the	directory,  or
       the  super-user.	  This feature is usefully applied to directories such
       as /tmp which must be publicly  writable	 but  should  deny  users  the
       license to arbitrarily delete or	rename each others' files.

       Any user	may create a sticky directory.	See _c_h_m_o_d(1) for details about
       modifying file modes.

BBUUGGSS
       Since the text areas of sticky text executables are stashed in the swap
       area, abuse of the feature can cause a system to	run out	of swap.

       Neither	_o_p_e_n(2)	 nor  _m_k_d_i_r(2)	will create a file with	the sticky bit
       set.
