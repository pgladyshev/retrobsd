       _G_e_t_t_y  is  usually  invoked  by	_i_n_i_t(8)	to open	and initialize the tty
       line, read a login name,	and invoke _l_o_g_i_n(1).  _g_e_t_t_y attempts to	 adapt
       the system to the speed and type	of terminal being used.

       The  argument  _t_t_y  is  the special device file in /dev to open for the
       terminal	(e.g., ``ttyh0'').  If there is	no argument or the argument is
       ``-'', the tty line is assumed to be open as file descriptor 0.

       The  _t_y_p_e  argument  can	 be used to make _g_e_t_t_y treat the terminal line
       specially.  This	argument is used as  an	 index	into  the  _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b(5)
       database, to determine the characteristics of the line.	If there is no
       argument, or there is no	such table, the	ddeeffaauulltt	 table	is  used.   If
       there  is  no //eettcc//ggeettttyyttaabb a set of system defaults is used.  If indi-
       cated by	the table located, _g_e_t_t_y will clear the	terminal screen, print
       a banner	heading, and prompt for	a login	name.  Usually either the ban-
       ner of the login	prompt will include the	 system	 hostname.   Then  the
       user's  name  is	 read,	a character at a time.	If a null character is
       received, it is assumed to be  the  result  of  the  user  pushing  the
       `break'	(`interrupt')  key.  The speed is usually then changed and the
       `login:'	is typed again;	a second `break' changes the speed  again  and
       the  `login:'  is typed once more.  Successive `break' characters cycle
       through the same	standard set of	speeds.

       The user's name is terminated by	a new-line or carriage-return  charac-
       ter.   The  latter  results  in	the system being set to	treat carriage
       returns appropriately (see _t_t_y(4)).

       The user's name is scanned to see if it contains	any lower-case	alpha-
       betic  characters;  if  not, and	if the name is nonempty, the system is
       told to map any future upper-case  characters  into  the	 corresponding
       lower-case characters.

       Finally,	_l_o_g_i_n is called	with the user's	name as	an argument.

       Most  of	the default actions of _g_e_t_t_y can be circumvented, or modified,
       by a suitable _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b table.

       _G_e_t_t_y can be set	to timeout after some interval,	which will cause  dial
       up  lines  to  hang  up	if  the	 login	name is	not entered reasonably
       quickly.

       terminal	 which	is turned on in	the _t_t_y_s file cannot be	opened,	likely
       because the requisite lines are either not configured into the  system,
       the associated device was not attached during boot-time system configu-
       ration, or the special file in /dev does	not exist.
