       A  link	is  a  directory  entry	 referring  to	a  file; the same file
       (together with its size,	all its	 protection  information,  etc.)   may
       have several links to it.  There	are two	kinds of links:	hard links and
       symbolic	links.

       By default _l_n makes hard	links.	A hard link to	a  file	 is  indistin-
       guishable  from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are
       effective independent of	the name used to  reference  the  file.	  Hard
       links may not span file systems and may not refer to directories.

       The --ss option causes _l_n to create symbolic links.  A symbolic link con-
       tains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The referenced  file
       is  used	when an	_o_p_e_n(2)	operation is performed on the link.  A _s_t_a_t(2)
       on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an _l_s_t_a_t(2) must  be
       done to obtain information about	the link.  The _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_k(2) call	may be
       used to read the	contents of a symbolic link.  Symbolic links may  span
       file systems and	may refer to directories.

       Given  one  or  two  arguments,	_l_n  creates a link to an existing file
       _s_o_u_r_c_e_n_a_m_e.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t_n_a_m_e is given, the	link has that name; _t_a_r_g_e_t_n_a_m_e
       may  also  be  a	 directory in which to place the link; otherwise it is
       placed in the current directory.	 If only the directory	is  specified,
       the link	will be	made to	the last component of _s_o_u_r_c_e_n_a_m_e.

       Given more than two arguments, _l_n makes links in	_t_a_r_g_e_t_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y	to all
       the named source	files.	The links made will have the same name as  the
       files being linked to.
