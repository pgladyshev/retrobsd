DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _T_e_l_n_e_t is used to communicate with another host using the TTEELLNNEETT	proto-
       col.  If	_t_e_l_n_e_t is invoked without arguments, it	enters	command	 mode,
       indicated by its	prompt ("telnet>").  In	this mode, it accepts and exe-
       cutes the commands listed below.	 If it is invoked with	arguments,  it
       performs	an ooppeenn	command	(see below) with those arguments.

       Once  a	connection  has	been opened, _t_e_l_n_e_t enters an input mode.  The
       input mode entered will be either "character at a  time"	 or  "line  by
       line" depending on what the remote system supports.

       In  "character  at a time" mode,	most text typed	is immediately sent to
       the remote host for processing.

       In "line	by line" mode, all text	is echoed locally, and (normally) only
       completed  lines	 are sent to the remote	host.  The "local echo charac-
       ter" (initially "^E") may be used to turn off and  on  the  local  echo
       (this  would  mostly  be	 used  to enter	passwords without the password
       being echoed).

       In either mode, if the _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s toggle	is TRUE	(the default  in  line
       mode;  see  below),  the	 user's	 _q_u_i_t,	_i_n_t_r, and _f_l_u_s_h	characters are
       trapped locally,	and sent as TTEELLNNEETT protocol sequences  to  the	remote
       side.   There  are  options  (see ttooggggllee	_a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h and ttooggggllee _a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h
       below) which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the	termi-
       nal  (until the remote host acknowledges	the TTEELLNNEETT sequence) and flush
       previous	terminal input (in the case of _q_u_i_t and	_i_n_t_r).

       While connected to a remote host, _t_e_l_n_e_t	command	mode may be entered by
       typing the _t_e_l_n_e_t "escape character" (initially "^]").  When in command
       mode, the normal	terminal editing conventions are available.

       CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

       The following commands are available.  Only enough of each  command  to
       uniquely	 identify it need be typed (this is also true for arguments to
       the mmooddee, sseett, ttooggggllee, and ddiissppllaayy commands).

       ooppeenn _h_o_s_t [ _p_o_r_t	]
	      Open a connection	to the named host.  If no port number is spec-
	      ified,  _t_e_l_n_e_t  will  attempt  to	contact	a TTEELLNNEETT server	at the
	      default port.  The host specification may	be either a host  name
	      (see  _h_o_s_t_s(5))  or  an  Internet	 address specified in the "dot
	      notation"	(see _i_n_e_t(3N)).

       cclloossee
	      Close a TTEELLNNEETT session and return	to command mode.

       qquuiitt
	      Close any	open TTEELLNNEETT session and	exit _t_e_l_n_e_t.  An end  of  file
	      (in command mode)	will also close	a session and exit.

       zz
	      Suspend  _t_e_l_n_e_t.	This command only works	when the user is using
	      the _c_s_h(1).

       mmooddee _t_y_p_e
	      _T_y_p_e is either _l_i_n_e (for "line by	line" mode) or _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r  (for
	      "character  at a time" mode).  The remote	host is	asked for per-
	      mission to go into the requested mode.  If the  remote  host  is
	      capable  of  entering  that  mode,  the  requested  mode will be
	      entered.

       ssttaattuuss
	      Show the current status of _t_e_l_n_e_t.  This includes	the  peer  one
	      is connected to, as well as the current mode.

       ddiissppllaayy [ _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_._._. ]
	      Displays all, or some, of	the sseett	and ttooggggllee values (see below).

       ?? [ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ]
	      Get  help.  With no arguments, _t_e_l_n_e_t prints a help summary.  If
	      a	command	is specified, _t_e_l_n_e_t will print	the  help  information
	      for just that command.

       sseenndd _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
	      Sends  one  or  more  special  character sequences to the	remote
	      host.  The following are the arguments which  may	 be  specified
	      (more than one argument may be specified at a time):

	      _e_s_c_a_p_e
		     Sends  the	 current  _t_e_l_n_e_t  escape  character (initially
		     "^]").

	      _s_y_n_c_h
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT SSYYNNCCHH sequence.	This  sequence	causes
		     the  remote  system  to discard all previously typed (but
		     not yet read) input.  This	sequence is sent as TCP	urgent
		     data  (and	may not	work if	the remote system is a 4.2 BSD
		     system -- if it doesn't work, a lower  case  "r"  may  be
		     echoed on the terminal).

	      _b_r_k
		     Sends  the	 TTEELLNNEETT	 BBRRKK  (Break) sequence,	which may have
		     significance to the remote	system.

	      _i_p
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT IIPP (Interrupt Process)  sequence,	 which
		     should  cause  the	 remote	 system	to abort the currently
		     running process.

	      _a_o
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT AAOO (Abort	Output)	sequence, which	should
		     cause  the	 remote	 system	 to  flush all output ffrroomm the
		     remote system ttoo the user's terminal.

	      _a_y_t
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT AAYYTT (Are You There) sequence,  to	 which
		     the remote	system may or may not choose to	respond.

	      _e_c
		     Sends  the	 TTEELLNNEETT	 EECC  (Erase Character) sequence, which
		     should cause the remote system to erase the last  charac-
		     ter entered.

	      _e_l
		     Sends  the	 TTEELLNNEETT	EELL (Erase Line)	sequence, which	should
		     cause the remote system to	erase the line currently being
		     entered.

	      _g_a
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT GGAA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely has
		     no	significance to	the remote system.

	      _n_o_p
		     Sends the TTEELLNNEETT NNOOPP (No OPeration) sequence.

	      _?
		     Prints out	help information for the sseenndd command.

       sseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e
	      Set any one of a number of _t_e_l_n_e_t	variables to a specific	value.
	      The  special  value "off"	turns off the function associated with
	      the variable.  The values	of variables may be interrogated  with
	      the ddiissppllaayy command.  The	variables which	may be specified are:

	      _e_c_h_o
		     This  is  the value (initially "^E") which, when in "line
		     by	line" mode, toggles between  doing  local  echoing  of
		     entered characters	(for normal processing), and suppress-
		     ing echoing of entered characters (for entering,  say,  a
		     password).

	      _e_s_c_a_p_e
		     This  is  the  _t_e_l_n_e_t  escape  character (initially "^[")
		     which causes entry	into _t_e_l_n_e_t command  mode  (when  con-
		     nected to a remote	system).

	      _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t
		     If	 _t_e_l_n_e_t	 is  in	_l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode	(see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     below) and	the _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t character	is typed, a TTEELLNNEETT  IIPP
		     sequence  (see sseenndd _i_p above) is sent to the remote host.
		     The initial value for the interrupt character is taken to
		     be	the terminal's iinnttrr character.

	      _q_u_i_t
		     If	 _t_e_l_n_e_t	 is  in	_l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode	(see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     below) and	the _q_u_i_t character  is	typed,	a  TTEELLNNEETT  BBRRKK
		     sequence (see sseenndd	_b_r_k above) is sent to the remote host.
		     The initial value for the quit character is taken	to  be
		     the terminal's qquuiitt character.

	      _f_l_u_s_h_o_u_t_p_u_t
		     If	 _t_e_l_n_e_t	 is  in	_l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode	(see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     below) and	the _f_l_u_s_h_o_u_t_p_u_t	character is typed,  a	TTEELLNNEETT
		     AAOO	 sequence  (see	 sseenndd  _a_o above) is sent to the	remote
		     host.  The	initial	value for the flush character is taken
		     to	be the terminal's fflluusshh	character.

	      _e_r_a_s_e
		     If	 _t_e_l_n_e_t	 is  in	_l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode	(see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     below), aanndd if _t_e_l_n_e_t is operating	 in  "character	 at  a
		     time"  mode,  then	when this character is typed, a	TTEELLNNEETT
		     EECC	sequence (see sseenndd _e_c above) is	 sent  to  the	remote
		     system.   The  initial  value  for	the erase character is
		     taken to be the terminal's	eerraassee character.

	      _k_i_l_l
		     If	_t_e_l_n_e_t is in _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s	mode  (see  ttooggggllee  _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     below),  aanndd  if  _t_e_l_n_e_t  is operating in "character at a
		     time" mode, then when this	character is typed,  a	TTEELLNNEETT
		     EELL	 sequence  (see	 sseenndd  _e_l above) is sent to the	remote
		     system.  The initial value	 for  the  kill	 character  is
		     taken to be the terminal's	kkiillll character.

	      _e_o_f
		     If	 _t_e_l_n_e_t	 is operating in "line by line"	mode, entering
		     this character as the first  character  on	 a  line  will
		     cause  this  character  to	 be sent to the	remote system.
		     The initial value of the eof character is taken to	be the
		     terminal's	eeooff character.

       ttooggggllee _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s_._._.
	      Toggle  (between	TRUE and FALSE)	various	flags that control how
	      _t_e_l_n_e_t responds to events.  More than one	argument may be	speci-
	      fied.   The  state  of  these flags may be interrogated with the
	      ddiissppllaayy command.	Valid arguments	are:

	      _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
		     If	this is	TRUE, then the _f_l_u_s_h, _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t, _q_u_i_t,	_e_r_a_s_e,
		     and  _k_i_l_l	characters  (see  sseett  above)  are  recognized
		     locally, and  transformed	into  (hopefully)  appropriate
		     TTEELLNNEETT  control  sequences	(respectively _a_o, _i_p, _b_r_k, _e_c,
		     and _e_l; see sseenndd above).  The initial value for this tog-
		     gle is TRUE in "line by line" mode, and FALSE in "charac-
		     ter at a time" mode.

	      _a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h
		     If	_a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h and _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s are both TRUE,	then when  the
		     _a_o,  _i_n_t_r,	 or _q_u_i_t characters are	recognized (and	trans-
		     formed into TTEELLNNEETT	sequences; see sseett above for details),
		     _t_e_l_n_e_t refuses to display any data	on the user's terminal
		     until the remote system acknowledges (via a TTEELLNNEETT	_T_i_m_i_n_g
		     _M_a_r_k   option)   that   it	 has  processed	 those	TTEELLNNEETT
		     sequences.	 The initial value for this toggle is TRUE  if
		     the  terminal  user had not done an "stty noflsh",	other-
		     wise FALSE	(see _s_t_t_y_(_1_)_)_.

	      _a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h
		     If	_a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h and _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s  are  both  TRUE,  then  when
		     either  the  _i_n_t_r	or  _q_u_i_t  characters is	typed (see sseett
		     above for descriptions of the _i_n_t_r	and _q_u_i_t  characters),
		     the  resulting  TTEELLNNEETT  sequence  sent is followed	by the
		     TTEELLNNEETT SSYYNNCCHH sequence.  This procedure sshhoouulldd  cause  the
		     remote system to begin throwing away all previously typed
		     input until both of the TTEELLNNEETT sequences have  been  read
		     and  acted	 upon.	 The  initial  value of	this toggle is
		     FALSE.

	      _c_r_m_o_d
		     Toggle carriage return mode.  When	this mode is  enabled,
		     most  carriage return characters received from the	remote
		     host will be mapped into a	carriage return	followed by  a
		     line  feed.   This	 mode does not affect those characters
		     typed by the user,	only those received  from  the	remote
		     host.   This  mode	 is  not very useful unless the	remote
		     host only sends carriage return,  but  never  line	 feed.
		     The initial value for this	toggle is FALSE.

	      _d_e_b_u_g
		     Toggles  socket level debugging (useful only to the _s_u_p_e_-
		     _ruser_)_.  The initial value	for this toggle	is FALSE.

	      _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
		     Toggles the display of some internal _t_e_l_n_e_t protocol pro-
		     cessing  (having to do with TTEELLNNEETT	options).  The initial
		     value for this toggle is FALSE.

	      _n_e_t_d_a_t_a
		     Toggles the display of all	network	data  (in  hexadecimal
		     format).  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

	      _?
		     Displays the legal	ttooggggllee commands.

BBUUGGSS
       There is	no adequate way	for dealing with flow control.

       On  some	 remote	 systems,  echo	 has to	be turned off manually when in
       "line by	line" mode.

       There is	enough settable	state to justify a ._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file.

       No capability for a ._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file is provided.

       In "line	by line" mode, the terminal's _e_o_f character is only recognized
       (and  sent  to  the  remote system) when	it is the first	character on a
       line.
