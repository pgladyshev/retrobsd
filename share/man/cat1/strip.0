       _S_t_r_i_p  removes the symbol table and relocation bits ordinarily attached
       to the output of	the assembler and loader.   This  is  useful  to  save
       space after a program has been debugged.

       The effect of _s_t_r_i_p is the same as use of the --ss	option of _l_d.
