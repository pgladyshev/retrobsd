       _M_k_d_e_p  takes  a	set of flags for the C compiler	and a list of C	source
       files as	arguments and constructs a set of include  file	 dependencies.
       It  attaches  this dependency list to the end of	the file ``Makefile''.
       An example of its use in	a makefile might be:

	      CFLAGS= -O -I../include -I.
	      SRCS= file1.c file2.c

	      depend:
		   mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}

       where the macro SRCS is the list	of C source files and the macro
       CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.	The --ff option
       provides	_m_k_d_e_p with a name other	than ``Makefile'' to be	edited.
       If the --pp option	is provided, _m_k_d_e_p produces dependencies
       of the form ``program: program.c'' so that subsequent makes will
       produce _p_r_o_g_r_a_m directly	from its C module rather than using an
       intermediate _._o module.	This is	useful in directories that
       contain many programs, each of whose source is contained	in a single
       C module.
