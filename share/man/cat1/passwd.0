       _P_a_s_s_w_d  changes	the  user's password.  First, the user is prompted for
       their old password, and then, if	that is	correct, for the new password.
       The  new	password must be entered twice to forestall any	typing errors.
       The super-user is not prompted for the old password.

       Once the	password has been verified, _p_a_s_s_w_d uses	_m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8) to	update
       the  user  database.  This is run in the	background, and, at very large
       sites could take	several	minutes.  Until	this update is completed,  the
       password	 file  is  unavailable	for other updates and the new password
       will not	be available to	programs.
