NNAAMMEE
       soelim -	eliminate .so's	from nroff input

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ssooeelliimm [	file ...  ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _S_o_e_l_i_m reads the	specified files	or the standard	input and performs the
       textual inclusion implied by the	_n_r_o_f_f directives of the	form

	    .so	somefile

       when they appear	at the beginning of input lines.  This is useful since
       programs	 such  as _t_b_l do not normally do this; it allows the placement
       of individual tables in separate	files to be run	as a part of  a	 large
       document.

       An argument consisting of a single minus	(--) is taken to	be a file name
       corresponding to	the standard input.

       Note that inclusion can be suppressed by	using `'' instead of `.', i.e.

	    'so	/usr/share/tmac/tmac.s

       A sample	usage of _s_o_e_l_i_m	would be

	    soelim exum?.n | tbl | nroff -ms | col | lpr

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       colcrt(1), more(1)

BBUUGGSS
       The format of the source	commands must involve no strangeness - exactly
       one blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.
