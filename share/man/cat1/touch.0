       _T_o_u_c_h  attempts	to  set	 the  modified	date  of each _f_i_l_e.  If	a _f_i_l_e
       exists, this is done by reading a character from	the file  and  writing
       it  back.   If a	_f_i_l_e does not exist, an	attempt	will be	made to	create
       it unless the --cc	option is specified.  The --ff option  will  attempt  to
       force the touch in spite	of read	and write permissions on a _f_i_l_e.
