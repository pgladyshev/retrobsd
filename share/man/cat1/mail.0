       _M_a_i_l  is	a intelligent mail processing system, which has	a command syn-
       tax reminiscent of _e_d with lines	replaced by messages.

       The --vv flag puts	mail into verbose mode;	the details  of	 delivery  are
       displayed on the	users terminal.	 The --ii	flag causes tty	interrupt sig-
       nals to be ignored. This	is particularly	 useful	 when  using  _m_a_i_l  on
       noisy phone lines.  The --nn flag inhibits	the reading of /etc/Mail.rc.

       _S_e_n_d_i_n_g	_m_a_i_l_.	To  send  a message to one or more people, _m_a_i_l	can be
       invoked with arguments which are	the names of people to whom  the  mail
       will  be	sent.  You are then expected to	type in	your message, followed
       by an EOT (control-D) at	the beginning of a line.   A  subject  may  be
       specified  on  the  command  line by using the --ss flag. (Only the first
       argument	after the --ss flag is used as a subject;	be  careful  to	 quote
       subjects	containing spaces.)  The section below,	labeled	_R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g _t_o _o_r
       _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g _m_a_i_l_, describes some	features of _m_a_i_l available to help you
       compose your letter.

       _R_e_a_d_i_n_g	_m_a_i_l_.	In  normal usage _m_a_i_l is given no arguments and	checks
       your mail out of	the post office, then prints out a one line header  of
       each message there.  The	current	message	is initially the first message
       (numbered 1) and	can be printed using the pprriinntt command (which  can  be
       abbreviated  pp).	  You  can  move  among	 the messages much as you move
       between lines in	_e_d, with the commands `+' and `-' moving backwards and
       forwards, and simple numbers.

       _D_i_s_p_o_s_i_n_g  _o_f  _m_a_i_l_.   After examining a	message	you can	ddeelleettee (dd) the
       message or rreeppllyy	(rr) to it.  Deletion causes the	_m_a_i_l program to	forget
       about  the  message.   This  is	not  irreversible;  the	message	can be
       uunnddeelleetteedd (uu) by	giving its number, or the _m_a_i_l session can be  aborted
       by  giving  the eexxiitt (xx)	command.  Deleted messages will, however, usu-
       ally disappear never to be seen again.

       _S_p_e_c_i_f_y_i_n_g _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s_.  Commands such as pprriinntt and	ddeelleettee can be given  a
       list  of	 message numbers as arguments to apply to a number of messages
       at once.	 Thus ``delete 1 2'' deletes messages 1	and 2, while  ``delete
       1-5''  deletes  messages	1 through 5.  The special name ``*'' addresses
       all messages, and ``$'' addresses the last message;  thus  the  command
       ttoopp  which  prints  the	first  few lines of a message could be used in
       ``top *'' to print the first few	lines of all messages.

       _R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g	_t_o _o_r _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g _m_a_i_l_.	 You can use the rreeppllyy command to  set
       up  a  response	to a message, sending it back to the person who	it was
       from.  Text you then type in, up	to an end-of-file,  defines  the  con-
       tents  of  the message.	While you are composing	a message, _m_a_i_l	treats
       lines beginning with the	character `~' specially.  For instance,	typing
       ``~m''  (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message into
       the response right shifting it by a tabstop.  Other escapes will	set up
       subject	fields,	add and	delete recipients to the message and allow you
       to escape to an editor to revise	the message or to a shell to run  some
       commands.  (These options are given in the summary below.)

       _E_n_d_i_n_g  _a _m_a_i_l _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_.  You can end a _m_a_i_l session with the
       qquuiitt (qq)	command.  Messages which have been examined go	to  your  _m_b_o_x
       file  unless  they  have	been deleted in	which case they	are discarded.
       Unexamined messages go back to the post office.	The --ff	option	causes
       _m_a_i_l  to	 read in the contents of your _m_b_o_x (or the specified file) for
       processing; when	you qquuiitt, _m_a_i_l writes undeleted	messages back to  this
       file.	The   --uu   flag	  is   a   short   way	 of   doing  "mail  --ff
       /usr/spool/mail/user".

       _P_e_r_s_o_n_a_l	_a_n_d _s_y_s_t_e_m_w_i_d_e _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t_s_.  It	is  also  possible  to
       create  a  personal  distribution  lists	so that, for instance, you can
       send mail to ``cohorts''	and have it go to a  group  of	people.	  Such
       lists can be defined by placing a line like

	      alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark	kridle@ucbcory

       in  the	file .mailrc in	your home directory.  The current list of such
       aliases can be displayed	with the aalliiaass ((aa)) command  in	_m_a_i_l.	System
       wide  distribution  lists  can  be created by editing /etc/aliases, see
       _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(5) and _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8); these are kept in a different  syntax.   In
       mail you	send, personal aliases will be expanded	in mail	sent to	others
       so that they will be able to rreeppllyy  to  the  recipients.	  System  wide
       _a_l_i_a_s_e_s	are not	expanded when the mail is sent,	but any	reply returned
       to the machine will have	the system wide	alias  expanded	 as  all  mail
       goes through _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l.

       _N_e_t_w_o_r_k	_m_a_i_l  _(_A_R_P_A_, _U_U_C_P_, _B_e_r_k_n_e_t_)  See _m_a_i_l_a_d_d_r_(_7_) for a description
       of network addresses.

       _M_a_i_l has	a number of options which can be set in	the  _._m_a_i_l_r_c  file  to
       alter  its  behavior; thus ``set	askcc''	enables	the ``askcc'' feature.
       (These options are summarized below.)

SSUUMMMMAARRYY
       (Adapted	from the `Mail Reference Manual')

       Each command is typed on	a line by itself, and may take arguments  fol-
       lowing the command word.	 The command need not be typed in its entirety
       - the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.   For  com-
       mands  which  take  message  lists  as arguments, if no message list is
       given, then the next message  forward  which  satisfies	the  command's
       requirements  is	used.  If there	are no messages	forward	of the current
       message,	the search proceeds backwards, and if there are	no  good  mes-
       sages at	all, _m_a_i_l types	``No applicable	messages'' and aborts the com-
       mand.

       --	   Goes	to the previous	message	and prints it out.  If given a
		   numeric  argument  _n, goes to the _n-th previous message and
		   prints it.

       ??	   Prints a brief summary of commands.

       !!	   Executes the	UNIX shell command which follows.

       PPrriinntt	   (PP) Like pprriinntt but also prints out ignored  header  fields.
		   See also pprriinntt , iiggnnoorree and rreettaaiinn..

       RReeppllyy	   (RR) Reply to	originator. Does not reply to other recipients
		   of the original message.

       TTyyppee	   (TT) Identical to the	PPrriinntt command.

       aalliiaass	   (aa) With no arguments,  prints  out	all  currently-defined
		   aliases.   With  one	argument, prints out that alias.  With
		   more	than one argument, creates an new or changes an	on old
		   alias.

       aalltteerrnnaatteess  (aalltt) The aalltteerrnnaatteess	command	is useful if you have accounts
		   on several machines.	 It can	be used	to  inform  _m_a_i_l  that
		   the listed addresses	are really you.	When you rreeppllyy to mes-
		   sages, _m_a_i_l will not	send a copy of the message to  any  of
		   the	addresses listed on the	_a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e_s list. If the	aalltteerr--
		   nnaatteess command is given with no argument, the	current	set of
		   alternate names is displayed.

       cchhddiirr	   (cc) Changes the user's working directory to that specified,
		   if given.  If no directory is given,	then  changes  to  the
		   user's login	directory.

       ccooppyy	   (ccoo)	 The  ccooppyy command does	the same thing that ssaavvee does,
		   except that it does not mark	the messages it	is used	on for
		   deletion when you quit.

       ddeelleettee	   (dd) Takes a list of messages	as argument and	marks them all
		   as deleted.	Deleted	messages will not be  saved  in	 _m_b_o_x,
		   nor will they be available for most other commands.

       ddpp	   (also  ddtt)  Deletes the current message and prints the next
		   message.  If	there is  no  next  message,  _m_a_i_l  says  ``at
		   EOF.''

       eeddiitt	   (ee)	Takes a	list of	messages and points the	text editor at
		   each	one in turn.  On return	from the editor,  the  message
		   is read back	in.

       eexxiitt	   (eexx	or xx) Effects an immediate return to the Shell without
		   modifying the user's	system mailbox,	his _m_b_o_x file, or  his
		   edit	file in	--ff.

       ffiillee	   (ffii)	The same as ffoollddeerr.

       ffoollddeerrss	   List	the names of the folders in your folder	directory.

       ffoollddeerr	   (ffoo)	 The  ffoollddeerr  command  switches	 to a new mail file or
		   folder. With	no arguments, it tells you which file you  are
		   currently  reading.	 If  you  give it an argument, it will
		   write out changes (such as deletions) you have made in  the
		   current file	and read in the	new file. Some special conven-
		   tions are recognized	for the	name.  #  means	 the  previous
		   file,  % means your system mailbox, %user means user's sys-
		   tem mailbox,	& means	your  /mbox file, and +folder means  a
		   file	in your	folder directory.

       ffrroomm	   (ff) Takes a list of messages	and prints their message head-
		   ers.

       hheeaaddeerrss	   (hh) Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18 mes-
		   sage	group.	If a ``+'' argument is given, then the next 18
		   message group is printed, and if a ``-'' argument is	given,
		   the previous	18 message group is printed.

       hheellpp	   A synonym for ?

       hhoolldd	   (hhoo,	 also  pprreesseerrvvee)  Takes	 a message list	and marks each
		   message therein to be saved in the  user's  system  mailbox
		   instead of in _m_b_o_x.	Does not override the ddeelleettee command.

       iiggnnoorree	   NN..BB..:: _I_g_n_o_r_e	has been superseded by _r_e_t_a_i_n_.
		   Add	the  list  of header fields named to the _i_g_n_o_r_e_d _l_i_s_t.
		   Header fields in the	ignore list are	not  printed  on  your
		   terminal  when  you	print  a message. This command is very
		   handy for suppression of certain  machine-generated	header
		   fields.  The	TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands	can be used to print a
		   message in  its  entirety,  including  ignored  fields.  If
		   iiggnnoorree  is executed with no arguments, it lists the current
		   set of ignored fields.

       mmaaiill	   (mm) Takes as	argument login names  and  distribution	 group
		   names and sends mail	to those people.

       mmbbooxx	   Indicate  that  a  list of messages be sent to _m_b_o_x in your
		   home	directory when you quit. This is  the  default	action
		   for messages	if you do _n_o_t have the _h_o_l_d option set.

       nneexxtt	   (nn  like  ++ or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and
		   types it.  With an argument list, types the	next  matching
		   message.

       pprreesseerrvvee	   (pprree) A synonym for hhoolldd.

       pprriinntt	   (pp)	Takes a	message	list and types out each	message	on the
		   user's terminal.

       qquuiitt	   (qq) Terminates the session, saving all  undeleted,  unsaved
		   messages  in	 the  user's _m_b_o_x file in his login directory,
		   preserving all messages marked with	hhoolldd  or  pprreesseerrvvee  or
		   never  referenced  in  his system mailbox, and removing all
		   other messages from his system mailbox.  If	new  mail  has
		   arrived  during  the	 session,  the	message	``You have new
		   mail'' is given.  If	given while  editing  a	 mailbox  file
		   with	 the  --ff  flag,	 then  the  edit file is rewritten.  A
		   return to the Shell is effected, unless the rewrite of edit
		   file	fails, in which	case the user can escape with the eexxiitt
		   command.

       rreeppllyy	   (rr) Takes a message list and	sends mail to the  sender  and
		   all	recipients of the specified message.  The default mes-
		   sage	must not be deleted.

       rreessppoonndd	   A synonym for rreeppllyy.

       rreettaaiinn	   Add the list	of header fields named to the  _r_e_t_a_i_n_e_d	 _l_i_s_t.
		   Only	the header fields in the retain	list are shown on your
		   terminal when you print a message.  All other header	fields
		   are suppressed.  The	TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands	can be used to
		   print a message in its entirety.   If  rreettaaiinn  is  executed
		   with	 no  arguments,	 it  lists the current set of retained
		   fields.

       ssaavvee	   (ss) Takes a message list and	a filename  and	 appends  each
		   message  in	turn  to the end of the	file.  The filename in
		   quotes, followed by the line	count and character  count  is
		   echoed on the user's	terminal.

       sseett	   (ssee)	With no	arguments, prints all variable values.	Other-
		   wise,   sets	  option.    Arguments	 are   of   the	  form
		   ``option=value''   (no   space   before   or	 after	=)  or
		   ``option.''

       sshheellll	   (sshh)	Invokes	an interactive version of the shell.

       ssiizzee	   Takes a message list	and prints out the size	in  characters
		   of each message.

       ssoouurrccee	   (ssoo)	The ssoouurrccee command reads _m_a_i_l commands from a file.

       ttoopp	   Takes  a message list and prints the	top few	lines of each.
		   The number of lines printed is controlled by	 the  variable
		   ttoopplliinneess and	defaults to five.

       ttyyppee	   (tt) A synonym for pprriinntt.

       uunnaalliiaass	   Takes  a  list  of names defined by aalliiaass commands and dis-
		   cards the remembered	groups of users.  The group  names  no
		   longer have any significance.

       uunnddeelleettee	   (uu)	Takes  a  message  list	 and marks each	message	as _n_o_t
		   being deleted.

       uunnrreeaadd	   (UU) Takes a message list and	marks each message as _n_o_t hav-
		   ing been read.

       uunnsseett	   Takes  a list of option names and discards their remembered
		   values; the inverse of sseett.

       vviissuuaall	   (vv) Takes a message list and	invokes	the display editor  on
		   each	message.

       wwrriittee	   (ww)	Similar	 to  ssaavvee,  except  that _o_n_l_y the message body
		   (_w_i_t_h_o_u_t the	header)	is saved.  Extremely useful  for  such
		   tasks as sending and	receiving source program text over the
		   message system.

       xxiitt	   (xx) A synonym for eexxiitt.

       zz	   _M_a_i_l	presents message headers in  windowfuls	 as  described
		   under  the  hheeaaddeerrss	command. You can move _m_a_i_l's attention
		   forward to the next window with the zz  command.  Also,  you
		   can move to the previous window by using zz--.

       Here  is	 a summary of the tilde	escapes, which are used	when composing
       messages	to perform special functions.  Tilde escapes are  only	recog-
       nized at	the beginning of lines.	 The name ``tilde escape'' is somewhat
       of a misnomer since the actual escape  character	 can  be  set  by  the
       option eessccaappee..

       ~~!!command   Execute  the	 indicated  shell  command, then return	to the
		   message.

       ~~bb name ... Add the given names to the list of carbon  copy  recipients
		   but	do not make the	names visible in the Cc: line ("blind"
		   carbon copy).

       ~~cc name ... Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.

       ~~dd	   Read	the file ``dead.letter'' from your home	directory into
		   the message.

       ~~ee	   Invoke  the	text  editor  on the message collected so far.
		   After the editing session is	 finished,  you	 may  continue
		   appending text to the message.

       ~~ff messages Read	the named messages into	the message being sent.	 If no
		   messages are	specified, read	in the current message.

       ~~hh	   Edit	the message header fields by typing each one  in  turn
		   and	allowing  the user to append text to the end or	modify
		   the field by	using the  current  terminal  erase  and  kill
		   characters.

       ~~mm messages Read	 the  named  messages  into  the  message  being sent,
		   shifted right one tab.  If no messages are specified,  read
		   the current message.

       ~~pp	   Print  out  the  message  collected so far, prefaced	by the
		   message header fields.

       ~~qq	   Abort the  message  being  sent,  copying  the  message  to
		   ``dead.letter'' in your home	directory if ssaavvee is set.

       ~~rr filename Read	the named file into the	message.

       ~~ss string   Cause the named string to become the	current	subject	field.

       ~~tt name ... Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

       ~~vv	   Invoke  an  alternate editor	(defined by the	VISUAL option)
		   on the message collected so far.   Usually,	the  alternate
		   editor will be a screen editor.  After you quit the editor,
		   you may resume appending text to the	end of your message.

       ~~ww filename Write the message onto the named file.

       ~~||command   Pipe	the message through the	command	as a filter.   If  the
		   command  gives  no  output or terminates abnormally,	retain
		   the original	text of	the message.  The  command  _f_m_t(1)  is
		   often used as _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to rejustify the message.

       ~~~~string	   Insert the string of	text in	the message prefaced by	a sin-
		   gle ~.  If you have changed the escape character, then  you
		   should double that character	in order to send it.

       Options	are controlled via the sseett and uunnsseett commands.	Options	may be
       either binary, in which case it is only significant to see whether they
       are  set	or not;	or string, in which case the actual value is of	inter-
       est.  The binary	options	include	the following:

       aappppeenndd	      Causes messages saved in _m_b_o_x to be appended to the  end
		      rather  than prepended.  (This is	set in /etc/Mail.rc on
		      2.11BSD systems.)

       aasskk	      Causes _m_a_i_l to prompt you	for the	subject	of  each  mes-
		      sage you send.  If you respond with simply a newline, no
		      subject field will be sent.

       aasskkcccc	      Causes you to be prompted	 for  additional  carbon  copy
		      recipients  at the end of	each message.  Responding with
		      a	newline	indicates your satisfaction with  the  current
		      list.

       aauuttoopprriinntt      Causes  the  ddeelleettee  command  to	behave like ddpp - thus,
		      after deleting a message,	the next  one  will  be	 typed
		      automatically.

       ddeebbuugg	      Setting  the binary option _d_e_b_u_g is the same as specify-
		      ing --dd on	the command line and causes _m_a_i_l to output all
		      sorts of information useful for debugging	_m_a_i_l.

       ddoott	      The  binary option _d_o_t causes _m_a_i_l to interpret a	period
		      alone on a line as the terminator	of a message  you  are
		      sending.

       hhoolldd	      This option is used to hold messages in the system mail-
		      box by default.

       iiggnnoorree	      Causes  interrupt	 signals  from	your  terminal	to  be
		      ignored and echoed as @'s.

       iiggnnoorreeeeooff      An  option  related to _d_o_t is _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f which makes _m_a_i_l
		      refuse to	accept a control-d as the end  of  a  message.
		      _I_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f	also applies to	_m_a_i_l command mode.

       mmeettoooo	      Usually,	when  a	 group	is  expanded that contains the
		      sender, the sender is removed from the expansion.	  Set-
		      ting this	option causes the sender to be included	in the
		      group.

       nnoossaavvee	      Normally,	when you abort a message with two RUBOUT, _m_a_i_l
		      copies the partial letter	to the file ``dead.letter'' in
		      your home	directory. Setting the	binary	option	_n_o_s_a_v_e
		      prevents this.

       RReeppllyyaallll	      Reverses the sense of _r_e_p_l_y and _R_e_p_l_y commands.

       qquuiieett	      Suppresses  the  printing	 of  the  version  when	 first
		      invoked.

       vveerrbboossee	      Setting the option _v_e_r_b_o_s_e is the	same as	using  the  --vv
		      flag  on	the  command  line.  When mail runs in verbose
		      mode, the	actual delivery	of messages is displayed on he
		      users terminal.

       The following options have string values:

       EDITOR	      Pathname	of  the	text editor to use in the eeddiitt command
		      and ~e escape.  If not defined, then a default editor is
		      used.

       PAGER	      Pathname	of  the	 program to use	in the mmoorree command or
		      when _c_r_t variable	is set.	 A default paginator  is  used
		      if this option is	not defined.

       SHELL	      Pathname	of  the	shell to use in	the !!  command and the
		      ~! escape.  A default shell is used if  this  option  is
		      not defined.

       VISUAL	      Pathname of the text editor to use in the	vviissuuaall command
		      and ~v escape.

       ccrrtt	      The valued option	_c_r_t is used as a threshold  to	deter-
		      mine  how	long a message must be before PPAAGGEERR is used to
		      read it.

       eessccaappee	      If defined, the first character of this option gives the
		      character	to use in the place of ~ to denote escapes.

       ffoollddeerr	      The  name	of the directory to use	for storing folders of
		      messages.	If this	name begins with a `/',	_m_a_i_l considers
		      it  to  be  an  absolute pathname; otherwise, the	folder
		      directory	is found relative to your home directory.

       rreeccoorrdd	      If defined, gives	the  pathname  of  the	file  used  to
		      record all outgoing mail.	 If not	defined, then outgoing
		      mail is not so saved.

       ttoopplliinneess	      If defined, gives	the number of lines of a message to be
		      printed  out  with  the ttoopp command; normally, the first
		      five lines are printed.

BBUUGGSS
       There are many flags that are not documented here. Most are not	useful
       to the general user.
       Usually,	_m_a_i_l is	just a link to _M_a_i_l, which can be confusing.
