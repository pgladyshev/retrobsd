       _L_e_a_v_e waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you have to
       leave.  You are reminded	5 minutes and 1	minute before the actual time,
       at  the	time,  and  every  minute thereafter.  When you	log off, _l_e_a_v_e
       exits just before it would have printed the next	message.

       The time	of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in hours	(on  a
       12  or 24 hour clock).  All times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and
       assumed to be in	the next 12 hours.

       If the time is preceeded	by `+',	the alarm will go  off	in  hours  and
       minutes from the	current	time.

       If  no  argument	 is  given,  _l_e_a_v_e  prompts  with "When	do you have to
       leave?".	A reply	of newline causes _l_e_a_v_e	to exit, otherwise  the	 reply
       is  assumed  to	be  a  time.  This form	is suitable for	inclusion in a
       _._l_o_g_i_n or _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e_.

       Leave ignores interrupts, quits,	and terminates.	 To get	rid of it  you
       should either log off or	use ``kill -9''	giving its process id.
