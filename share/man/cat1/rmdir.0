       _R_m_d_i_r removes entries for the named directories,	which must be empty.

       _R_m  removes  the	entries	for one	or more	files from a directory.	 If an
       entry was the last link to the file, the	file is	destroyed.  Removal of
       a file requires write permission	in its directory, but neither read nor
       write permission	on the file itself.

       If a file has no	write permission and the standard input	is a terminal,
       its permissions are printed and a line is read from the standard	input.
       If that line begins with	`y' the	file is	deleted,  otherwise  the  file
       remains.	 No questions are asked	and no errors are reported when	the --ff
       (force) option is given.

       If a designated file is a directory, an error comment is	printed	unless
       the  optional  argument --rr has been used.  In that case,	_r_m recursively
       deletes the entire contents of the specified directory, and the	direc-
       tory itself.

       If  the --ii (interactive)	option is in effect, _r_m	asks whether to	delete
       each file, and, under --rr, whether to examine each directory.

       The null	option -- indicates that	all the	arguments following it are  to
       be  treated as file names.  This	allows the specification of file names
       starting	with a minus.
