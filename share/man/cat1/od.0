       _O_d  displays  _f_i_l_e, or it's standard input, in one or more dump formats
       as selected by the first	argument.  If the first	argument  is  missing,
       --oo is the default.  Dumping continues until end-of-file.

       The meanings of the format argument characters are:

       aa    Interpret  bytes  as  characters and display them with their ACSII
	    names.  If the pp character is given	also,  then  bytes  with  even
	    parity are underlined.  The	PP character causes bytes with odd par-
	    ity	to be underlined.  Otherwise the parity	bit is ignored.

       bb    Interpret bytes as unsigned	octal.

       cc    Interpret bytes as ASCII characters.  Certain non-graphic  charac-
	    ters appear	as C escapes: null=\0, backspace=\b, formfeed=\f, new-
	    line=\n, return=\r,	tab=\t;	others appear as  3-digit  octal  num-
	    bers.  Bytes with the parity bit set are displayed in octal.

       dd    Interpret (short) words as unsigned	decimal.

       ff    Interpret long words as floating point.

       hh    Interpret (short) words as unsigned	hexadecimal.

       ii    Interpret (short) words as signed decimal.

       ll    Interpret long words as signed decimal.

       oo    Interpret (short) words as unsigned	octal.

       ss[n] Look  for  strings	of ascii graphic characters, terminated	with a
	    null byte.	_N specifies the	minimum	length	string	to  be	recog-
	    nized.  By default,	the minimum length is 3	characters.

       vv    Show all data. By default, display lines that are identical	to the
	    last line shown are	not output, but	are indicated with an ``*'' in
	    column 1.

       ww[n] Specifies  the  number  of	input bytes to be interpreted and dis-
	    played on each output line.	If ww is	not specified,	16  bytes  are
	    read for each display line.	 If _n is not specified,	it defaults to
	    32.

       xx    Interpret (short) words as hexadecimal.

       An upper	case format character implies the  long	 or  double  precision
       form of the object.

       The _o_f_f_s_e_t argument specifies the byte offset into the file where dump-
       ing is to commence.  By default this argument is	interpreted in	octal.
       A  different  radix can be specified; If	``..'' is appended to the argu-
       ment, then _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted	in decimal.   If  _o_f_f_s_e_t  begins  with
       ``xx'' or	``00xx'',	it is interpreted in hexadecimal.  If ``bb'' (``BB'') is
       appended, the offset is interpreted as a	block count, where a block  is
       512  (1024) bytes.  If the _f_i_l_e argument	is omitted, an _o_f_f_s_e_t argument
       must be preceded	by ``++''.

       The radix of the	displayed address will be the same as the radix	of the
       _o_f_f_s_e_t, if specified; otherwise it will be octal.

       _L_a_b_e_l  will  be interpreted as a	pseudo-address for the first byte dis-
       played.	It will	be shown in ``()'' following the file offset.	It  is
       intended	 to  be	 used  with  core  images  to indicate the real	memory
       address.	 The syntax for	_l_a_b_e_l is identical to that for _o_f_f_s_e_t.

BBUUGGSS
       A file name argument can't start	 with  ``+''.	A  hexadecimal	offset
       can't be	a block	count.	Only one file name argument can	be given.

       It  is  an  historical botch to require specification of	object,	radix,
       and sign	representation in a single character argument.
