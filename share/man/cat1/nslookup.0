       _N_s_l_o_o_k_u_p	 is  a	program	 to  query DARPA Internet domain name servers.
       Nslookup	has two	modes: interactive and	non-interactive.   Interactive
       mode  allows  the  user	to query the name server for information about
       various	hosts and domains or print a list  of  hosts  in  the  domain.
       Non-interactive	mode  is  used	to  print  just	 the name and Internet
       address of a host or domain.


AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       Interactive mode	is entered in the following cases:

       a)  when	no arguments are given (the default name server	will be	used),
	   and

       b)  when	 the first argument is a hyphen	(-) and	the second argument is
	   the host name of a name server.

       Non-interactive mode is used when the name of the host to be looked  up
       is  given as the	first argument.	The optional second argument specifies
       a name server.

       Commands	may be interrupted at any time	by  typing  a  control-C.   To
       exit,  type  a  control-D  (EOF).  The command line length must be less
       than 80 characters.  NN..BB.. an unrecognized command will  be  interpreted
       as a host name.


       host [server]
	      Look up information for _h_o_s_t using the current default server or
	      using _s_e_r_v_e_r if it is specified.


       sseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
       llsseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
	      Change the default server	to _d_o_m_a_i_n.  LLsseerrvveerr uses  the  initial
	      server to	look up	information about _d_o_m_a_i_n while sseerrvveerr uses the
	      current default server.  If an  authoritative  answer  can't  be
	      found,  the  names  of  servers  that  might have	the answer are
	      returned.


       rroooott   Changes the default server to the	server for  the	 root  of  the
	      domain  name  space.   Currently,	the host sri-nic.arpa is used.
	      (This command is a synonym for the llsseerrvveerr  ssrrii--nniicc..aarrppaa.)   The
	      name  of	the  root server can be	changed	with the sseett rroooott com-
	      mand.


       ffiinnggeerr [_n_a_m_e] [>>	_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
       ffiinnggeerr [_n_a_m_e] [>>>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	      Connects with the	finger server on the current host.   The  cur-
	      rent  host is defined when a previous lookup for a host was suc-
	      cessful and returned address information	(see  the  sseett	qquueerryy--
	      ttyyppee==AA command).	_N_a_m_e is	optional.  >> and >>>> can	be used	to re-
	      direct output in the usual manner.

       llss --dd _d_o_m_a_i_n [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	      List the information available for _d_o_m_a_i_n.  The  default	output
	      contains host names and their Internet addresses.	 The --aa	option
	      lists aliases of hosts in	the domain.  The --hh option  lists  CPU
	      and  operating system information	for the	domain.	 The --dd	option
	      lists all	contents of a zone transfer.  When output is  directed
	      to  a file, hash marks are printed for every 50 records received
	      from the server.


       vviieeww _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
	      Sorts and	lists  the  output  of	previous  llss  command(s)  with
	      _m_o_r_e(1).


       hheellpp

       ??      Prints a brief summary of	commands.


       sseett _k_e_y_w_o_r_d[=_v_a_l_u_e]
	      This  command  is	 used to change	state information that affects
	      the lookups.  Valid keywords are:

	      aallll    Prints the	current	values of the various options to  sseett.
		     Information about the  current default server and host is
		     also printed.

	      [[nnoo]]ddeebbuugg
		     Turn debugging mode on. A lot more	information is printed
		     about  the	 packet	 sent  to the server and the resulting
		     answer.
		     (Default =	nodebug, abbreviation =	[no]deb)

	      [[nnoo]]dd22 Turn  exhaustive  debugging  mode	on.   Essentially  all
		     fields of every packet are	printed.
		     (Default =	nod2)

	      [[nnoo]]ddeeffnnaammee
		     Append the	default	domain name to every lookup.
		     (Default =	defname, abbreviation =	[no]def)

	      [[nnoo]]sseeaarrcchh
		     With  defname,  search for	each name in parent domains of
		     the current domain.
		     (Default =	search)

	      ddoommaaiinn==_n_a_m_e
		     Change the	default	domain	name  to  _n_a_m_e.	  The  default
		     domain  name  is  appended	 to all	lookup requests	if the
		     ddeeffnnaammee option has	been set.  The search list is  set  to
		     parents  of  the  domain  with at least two components in
		     their names.
		     (Default =	value in hostname or /etc/resolv.conf,	abbre-
		     viation = do)

	      qquueerryyttyyppee==_v_a_l_u_e

	      ttyyppee==_v_a_l_u_e
		     Change  the  type of information returned from a query to
		     one of:

		     A	       the host's Internet address (the	default).

		     CNAME     the canonical name for an alias.

		     HINFO     the host	CPU and	operating system type.

		     MD	       the mail	destination.

		     MX	       the mail	exchanger.

		     MG	       the mail	group member.

		     MINFO     the mailbox or mail list	information.

		     MR	       the mail	rename domain name.

		     NS	       nameserver for the named	zone.
	      Other types specified in	the  RFC883  document  are  valid  but
	      aren't very useful.
	      (Abbreviation = q)

	      [[nnoo]]rreeccuurrssee
		     Tell  the	name  server to	query other servers if it does
		     not have the information.
		     (Default =	recurse, abbreviation =	[no]rec)

	      rreettrryy==_n_u_m_b_e_r
		     Set the number of retries to _n_u_m_b_e_r.  When	a reply	 to  a
		     request  is  not received within a	certain	amount of time
		     (changed with sseett ttiimmeeoouutt), the request is	 resent.   The
		     retry  value  controls how	many times a request is	resent
		     before giving up.
		     (Default =	2, abbreviation	= ret)

	      rroooott==_h_o_s_t
		     Change the	name of	the root server	to _h_o_s_t. This  affects
		     the rroooott command.
		     (Default =	sri-nic.arpa, abbreviation = ro)

	      ttiimmeeoouutt==_n_u_m_b_e_r
		     Change  the  time-out interval for	waiting	for a reply to
		     _n_u_m_b_e_r seconds.
		     (Default =	10 seconds, abbreviation = t)

	      [[nnoo]]vvcc Always use	a virtual circuit when sending requests	to the
		     server.
		     (Default =	novc, abbreviation = [no]v)

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       If  the lookup request was not successful, an error message is printed.
       Possible	errors are:

       Time-out
	      The server did not respond to a request after a  certain	amount
	      of time (changed with sseett	ttiimmeeoouutt==_v_a_l_u_e) and a certain number of
	      retries (changed with sseett	rreettrryy==_v_a_l_u_e).

       No information
	      Depending	on the query type set with the sseett qquueerryyttyyppee  command,
	      no  information  about  the  host	was available, though the host
	      name is valid.

       Non-existent domain
	      The host or domain name does not exist.

       Connection refused
       Network is unreachable
	      The connection to	the name or finger server could	not be made at
	      the  current  time.   This  error	 commonly  occurs  with	ffiinnggeerr
	      requests.

       Server failure
	      The name server found an internal	inconsistency in its  database
	      and could	not return a valid answer.

       Refused
	      The name server refused to service the request.


       The following error should not occur and	it indicates a bug in the pro-
       gram.

       Format error
	      The name server found that the request packet  was  not  in  the
	      proper format.


FFIILLEESS
       /etc/resolv.conf	   initial domain name and name	server addresses.
