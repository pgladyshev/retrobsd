       _C_r_o_n_t_a_b  is  the  program used to install, deinstall or list the tables
       used to drive the _c_r_o_n(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.   Each  user  can  have
       their  own  crontab,  and  though these are files in /var, they are not
       intended to be edited directly.

       If the _a_l_l_o_w file exists, then you must be listed therein in  order  to
       be  allowed  to use this command.  If the _a_l_l_o_w file does not exist but
       the _d_e_n_y file does exist, then you must nnoott be listed in the _d_e_n_y  file
       in  order  to use this command.  If neither of these files exists, then
       depending on site-dependent configuration parameters,  only  the  super
       user  will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to
       use this command.

       If the _-_u option is given, it specifies the  name  of  the  user  whose
       crontab  is  to be tweaked.  If this option is not given, _c_r_o_n_t_a_b exam‐
       ines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the com‐
       mand.   Note that _s_u(8) can confuse _c_r_o_n_t_a_b and that if you are running
       inside of _s_u(8) you should always use the _-_u option for safety's sake.

       The first form of this command is used to install a  new  crontab  from
       some  named  file  or  standard  input  if the pseudo-filename ``-'' is
       given.

       The _-_l option causes the current crontab to be  displayed  on  standard
       output.

       The _-_r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The  _-_e  option  is  used  to edit the current crontab using the editor
       specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR  environment  variables.   After  you
       exit  from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automati‐
       cally.

       The _c_r_o_n_t_a_b command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').   This
       new  command  syntax  differs  from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as
       well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run  it  with  a  bad
       command line.
