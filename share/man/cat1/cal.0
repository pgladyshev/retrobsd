       _C_a_l prints a calendar for the specified year.  If a month is also spec-
       ified, a	calendar just for that month is	printed.  _Y_e_a_r can be  between
       1 and 9999.  The	_m_o_n_t_h is a number between 1 and	12.  The calendar pro-
       duced is	that for England and her colonies.

       Try September 1752.

BBUUGGSS
       The year	is always considered to	start in January even though  this  is
       historically naive.
       Beware  that  `cal  78' refers to the early Christian era, not the 20th
       century.
