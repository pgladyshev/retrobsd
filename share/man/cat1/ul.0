       _U_l  reads  the  named  files  (or standard input	if none	are given) and
       translates occurrences of underscores to	the sequence  which  indicates
       underlining  for	 the  terminal in use, as specified by the environment
       variable	TERM.  The --tt option overrides the terminal kind specified  in
       the environment.	 The file _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p is read to determine the	appro-
       priate sequences	for underlining.  If  the  terminal  is	 incapable  of
       underlining,  but  is  capable  of  a  standout	mode then that is used
       instead.	 If the	terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining	 auto-
       matically, _u_l degenerates to _c_a_t(1).  If	the terminal cannot underline,
       underlining is ignored.

       The --ii option causes _u_l to indicate underlining onto by a separate line
       containing appropriate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look
       at the underlining which	is present in an _n_r_o_f_f output stream on	a crt-
       terminal.

       _N_r_o_f_f  usually outputs a	series of backspaces and underlines intermixed
       with the	text to	indicate underlining.  No attempt is made to  optimize
       the backward motion.
