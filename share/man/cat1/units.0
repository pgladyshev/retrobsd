       _U_n_i_t_s converts quantities expressed in various standard scales to their
       equivalents in other scales.  It	works interactively in this fashion:

	    _Y_o_u	_h_a_v_e_: inch
	    _Y_o_u	_w_a_n_t_: cm
		 _* _2_._5_4_0_0_0_e_+_0_0
		 _/ _3_._9_3_7_0_1_e_-_0_1

       A quantity is  specified	 as  a	multiplicative	combination  of	 units
       optionally  preceded  by	a numeric multiplier.  Powers are indicated by
       suffixed	positive integers, division by the usual sign:

	    _Y_o_u	_h_a_v_e_: 15 pounds	force/in2
	    _Y_o_u	_w_a_n_t_: atm
		 _* _1_._0_2_0_6_9_e_+_0_0
		 _/ _9_._7_9_7_3_0_e_-_0_1

       _U_n_i_t_s only does multiplicative scale  changes.	Thus  it  can  convert
       Kelvin  to  Rankine,  but  not Centigrade to Fahrenheit.	 Most familiar
       units, abbreviations, and metric	prefixes are recognized, together with
       a  generous  leavening of exotica and a few constants of	nature includ-
       ing:

	    pi	 ratio of circumference	to diameter
	    c	 speed of light
	    e	 charge	on an electron
	    g	 acceleration of gravity
	    force     same as g
	    mole Avogadro's number
	    water     pressure head per	unit height of water
	    au	 astronomical unit

       `Pound' is a unit of mass.   Compound  names  are  run  together,  e.g.
       `lightyear'.   British units that differ	from their US counterparts are
       prefixed	 thus:	`brgallon'.   Currency	is   denoted   `belgiumfranc',
       `britainpound', ...
