       _A_t_q  prints  the	 queue	of  jobs that are waiting to be	run at a later
       date. These jobs	were created with the _a_t(1) command.  With  no	flags,
       the queue is sorted in the order	that the jobs will be executed.

       If  the	--cc  flag  is used, the queue is	sorted by the time that	the _a_t
       command was given.

       The --nn flag prints only the total number	of files that are currently in
       the queue.

       If  a  name(s)  is provided, only those files belonging to that user(s)
       are displayed.
