       _D_u  gives  the  number  of kilobytes contained in all files and,	recur-
       sively, directories within each specified directory or file  _n_a_m_e.   If
       _n_a_m_e is missing,	`..'  is	used.

       The  argument --ss	causes only the	grand total to be given.  The argument
       --aa causes an entry to be	generated for each file.   Absence  of	either
       causes an entry to be generated for each	directory only.

       A file which has	two links to it	is only	counted	once.

       Non-directories	given  as  arguments  (not  under  --aa  option) are not
       listed.
       If there	are too	many distinct linked files, _d_u counts the excess files
       multiply.
