       _L_a_s_t  will  look	 back  in  the	_w_t_m_p file which	records	all logins and
       logouts for information about a user, a teletype	or any group of	 users
       and teletypes.  Arguments specify names of users	or teletypes of	inter-
       est.  Names of teletypes	may be given fully or abbreviated.  For	 exam-
       ple  `last  0'  is  the same as `last tty0'.  If	multiple arguments are
       given, the information  which  applies  to  any	of  the	 arguments  is
       printed.	  For  example	`last root console' would list all of "root's"
       sessions	as well	as all sessions	on the console	terminal.   _L_a_s_t  will
       print  the  sessions  of	the specified users and	teletypes, most	recent
       first, indicating the times at which the	session	began, the duration of
       the  session, and the teletype which the	session	took place on.	If the
       session is still	continuing or was cut short by a reboot, _l_a_s_t so indi-
       cates.

       The pseudo-user rreebboooott logs in at reboots of the	system,	thus

	    last reboot

       will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

       _L_a_s_t  with  no  arguments prints	a record of all	logins and logouts, in
       reverse order.  The --ff ffiilleennaammee option allows the user  to  examine  an
       alternate _w_t_m_p file.  The --NN option limits the report to	N lines.

       If  _l_a_s_t	is interrupted,	it indicates how far the search	has progressed
       in _w_t_m_p_.	 If interrupted	with a quit signal (generated by a  control-\)
       _l_a_s_t indicates how far the search has progressed	so far,	and the	search
       continues.
