       _T_n_3_2_7_0  permits	a  full-screen,	full-duplex connection from a VAX UNIX
       machine to an IBM machine running VM/CMS	giving the appearance of being
       logged  in  directly to the remote machine on an	IBM 3270 terminal.  Of
       course you must have an account on the machine to  which	 you  wish  to
       connect	in order to log	in.  _T_n_3_2_7_0 looks to the user in many respects
       like the	Yale ASCII Terminal Communication System II.  _T_n_3_2_7_0 is	 actu-
       ally  a	modification  of  the  Arpanet TELNET user interface (see _t_e_l_-
       _n_e_t(1)) that interprets and generates raw 3270 control streams.

       Emulation of the	3270 terminal is done in the Unix process.  This  emu-
       lation  involves	 mapping 3270-style commands from the host into	appro-
       priate sequences	to control the user's terminal	screen.	  _T_n_3_2_7_0  uses
       _c_u_r_s_e_s(3x)  and	the  _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p file to do this.  The	emulation also
       involves	simulating the special 3270 keyboard  keys  (program  function
       keys, etc.)  by mapping sequences of keystrokes from the	ASCII keyboard
       into appropriate	3270 control strings.  This mapping is terminal	depen-
       dent  and  is specified in a description	file, _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0,
       (see _m_a_p_3_2_7_0(5))	or in an environment variable _M_A_P_3_2_7_0  (see  _m_s_e_t(1)).
       Any  special function keys on the ASCII keyboard	are used whenever pos-
       sible.  If an entry for the user's terminal is not found, _t_n_3_2_7_0	 looks
       for  an	entry  for  the	 terminal type uunnkknnoowwnn..	 If this is not	found,
       _t_n_3_2_7_0 uses a default keyboard mapping (see _m_a_p_3_2_7_0(5)).

       The first character of each special keyboard mapping sequence is	either
       an  ASCII  escape (ESC),	a control character, or	an ASCII delete	(DEL).
       If the user types an unrecognized function key sequence,	 _t_n_3_2_7_0	 sends
       an  ASCII bell (BEL), or	a visual bell if defined in the	user's termcap
       entry, to the user's terminal and nothing is sent to the	IBM host.

       If _t_n_3_2_7_0 is invoked without specifying a remote	host system  name,  it
       enters  local  command  mode,  indicated	by the prompt ``tn3270>''.  In
       this mode, _t_n_3_2_7_0 accepts and executes the following commands:

	    open      connect to a remote host
	    close     close the	current	connection
	    quit      exit tn3270
	    z	      suspend tn3270
	    status    print connection status
	    ?	      print help information

       Other common _t_e_l_n_e_t commands are	not available in _t_n_3_2_7_0_.  _T_n_3_2_7_0  com-
       mand  mode may also be entered, after connecting	to a host, by typing a
       special escape character	(typically control-C).

       While in	command	mode, any host login session is	still alive but	tempo-
       rarily suspended.  The host login session may be	resumed	by entering an
       empty line (press the RETURN key) in response to	the command prompt.  A
       session may be terminated by logging off	the foreign host, or by	typing
       ``quit''	or ``close'' while in local command mode.

       Performance is slow and uses system resources prodigiously.

       Not all 3270 functions are supported, nor all Yale enhancements.
