       _M_s_g_s is used to read system messages.  These messages are sent by mail-
       ing to the login	`msgs' and should be short pieces of information which
       are suitable to be read once by most users of the system.

       _M_s_g_s is normally	invoked	each time you login, by	placing	it in the file
       _._l_o_g_i_n _(_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e	if you use _/_b_i_n_/_s_h).  It will then prompt you with the
       source  and  subject of each new	message.  If there is no subject line,
       the first few non-blank lines of	the message  will  be  displayed.   If
       there is	more to	the message, you will be told how long it is and asked
       whether you wish	 to  see  the  rest  of	 the  message.	 The  possible
       responses are:

       yy      type the rest of the message.

       RETURN synonym for y.

       nn      skip this	message	and go on to the next message.

       --      redisplay	the last message.

       qq      drops you	out of _m_s_g_s_; the next time you run the program it will
	      pick up where you	left off.

       ss      append the current message to the	file ``Messages'' in the  cur-
	      rent directory; `s-' will	save the previously displayed message.
	      A	`s' or `s-' may	be followed by a space	and  a	file  name  to
	      receive the message replacing the	default	``Messages''.

       mm      or `m-' causes a copy of the specified message to	be placed in a
	      temporary	mailbox	and _m_a_i_l(1) to be  invoked  on	that  mailbox.
	      Both `m' and `s' accept a	numeric	argument in place of the `-'.

       _M_s_g_s  keeps  track  of the next message you will	see by a number	in the
       file _._m_s_g_s_r_c in your home directory.  In	 the  directory	 _/_u_s_r_/_m_s_g_s  it
       keeps  a	 set  of files whose names are the (sequential)	numbers	of the
       messages	they represent.	 The file _/_u_s_r_/_m_s_g_s_/_b_o_u_n_d_s shows the  low  and
       high  number  of	the messages in	the directory so that _m_s_g_s can quickly
       determine if there are no messages for you.  If the contents of	_b_o_u_n_d_s
       is  incorrect  it  can  be  fixed  by removing it; _m_s_g_s will make a new
       _b_o_u_n_d_s file the next time it is run.

       The --ss option is	used for setting up the	posting	of messages.  The line

	      msgs: "| /usr/ucb/msgs -s"

       should be include in _/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s to enable posting of messages.

       The --cc option is	used for performing cleanup on	_/_u_s_r_/_m_s_g_s_.   An	 entry
       with the	--cc option should be placed in _/_e_t_c_/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b to run every	night.
       This will remove	all messages over 21 days old.	A different expiration
       may be specified	on the command line to override	the default.

       Options when reading messages include:

       --ff     which causes it not to say ``No new messages.''.	This is	useful
	      in your _._l_o_g_i_n file since	this is	often the case here.

       --qq     Queries whether there are	messages,  printing  ``There  are  new
	      messages.'' if there are.	 The command ``msgs -q'' is often used
	      in login scripts.

       --hh     causes _m_s_g_s to print the first part of messages only.

       --ll     option causes only locally originated messages to	be reported.

       _n_u_m    A	message	number can be given on the command line, causing  _m_s_g_s
	      to  start	 at the	specified message rather than at the next mes-
	      sage indicated by	your _._m_s_g_s_r_c file.  Thus


		  msgs -h 1

	      prints the first part of all messages.

       _-_n_u_m_b_e_r
	      will cause _m_s_g_s to start _n_u_m_b_e_r messages back from the one indi-
	      cated  by	 your  _._m_s_g_s_r_c file, useful for	reviews	of recent mes-
	      sages.

       --pp     causes long messages to be piped through _m_o_r_e(1).

       Within _m_s_g_s you can also	go to any specific message by typing its  num-
       ber when	_m_s_g_s requests input as to what to do.
