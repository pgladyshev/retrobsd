       _W_h_o_,  without  an  argument,  lists  the	login name, terminal name, and
       login time for each current UNIX	user.

       Without an argument, _w_h_o	examines the _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_u_t_m_p file	to obtain  its
       information.  If	a file is given, that file is examined.	 Typically the
       given file will be /usr/adm/wtmp, which contains	a record  of  all  the
       logins  since  it  was  created.	  Then	_w_h_o lists logins, logouts, and
       crashes since the creation of the wtmp file.  Each login	is listed with
       user  name, terminal name (with `/dev/' suppressed), and	date and time.
       When an argument	is given, logouts produce a  similar  line  without  a
       user  name.  Reboots produce a line with	`x' in the place of the	device
       name, and a fossil time indicative of when the system went down.

       With two	arguments, as in `who am I' (and  also	`who  are  you'),  _w_h_o
       tells who you are logged	in as.
