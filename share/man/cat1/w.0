       _W  prints  a  summary  of the current activity on the system, including
       what each user is doing.

       The _u_p_t_i_m_e invocation prints only the header line.

       The heading line	shows the current time of day, how long	the system has
       been up,	the number of users logged into	the system, and	the load aver-
       ages.  The load average numbers give the	number	of  jobs  in  the  run
       queue averaged over 1, 5	and 15 minutes.

       The  fields  output  are: the users login name, the name	of the tty the
       user is on, the time of day the user logged on, the number  of  minutes
       since  the user last typed anything, the	CPU time used by all processes
       and their children on that terminal, the	CPU time used by the currently
       active processes, the name and arguments	of the current process.

       The  --hh flag suppresses the heading.  The --ss flag asks for a short form
       of output.  In the short	form, the tty is abbreviated, the  login  time
       and cpu times are left off, as are the arguments	to commands.

       The  --ww	and  --uu	 flags	force  the  _w and _u_p_t_i_m_e actions respectively,
       regardless of the name the program is invoked as.

       If a _u_s_e_r name is included, the output will be restricted to that user.

       The notion of the ``current process'' is	muddy.	The current  algorithm
       is  ``the highest numbered process on the terminal that is not ignoring
       interrupts, or, if there	is none, the highest numbered process  on  the
       terminal''.   This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs
       like the	shell and editor, or when faulty programs running in the back-
       ground  fork and	fail to	ignore interrupts.  (In	cases where no process
       can be found, _w prints ``-''.)

       The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular,	if  someone  leaves  a
       background  processs running after logging out, the person currently on
       that terminal is	``charged'' with the time.

       Background processes are	not shown, even	though they account  for  much
       of the load on the system.

       Sometimes  processes,  typically	 those	in the background, are printed
       with null or garbaged arguments.	 In these cases, the name of the  com-
       mand is printed in parentheses.
