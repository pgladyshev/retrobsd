       _F_m_t  is	a simple text formatter	which reads the	concatenation of input
       files (or standard input	if none	are given) and	produces  on  standard
       output a	version	of its input with lines	as close to 72 characters long
       as possible.  The spacing at the	beginning of the input lines  is  pre-
       served in the output, as	are blank lines	and interword spacing.

       _F_m_t  is meant to	format mail messages prior to sending, but may also be
       useful for other	simple tasks.  For instance, within visual mode	of the
       _e_x editor (e.g.	_v_i) the	command
	    !}fmt
       will reformat a paragraph, evening the lines.

       The program was designed	to be simple and fast -	for more complex oper-
       ations, the standard text processors are	likely to be more appropriate.
