       _R_s_h connects to the specified _h_o_s_t_, and executes	the specified _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.
       _R_s_h copies its standard input to	the remote command, the	standard  out-
       put  of	the  remote  command  to its standard output, and the standard
       error of	the remote command to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit and
       terminate  signals  are	propagated to the remote command; _r_s_h normally
       terminates when the remote command does.

       The remote username used	is the same as your local username, unless you
       specify	a  different remote name with the --ll option.  This remote name
       must be equivalent (in the sense	 of  _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C))  to  the  originating
       account;	no provision is	made for specifying a password with a command.

       If  you	omit  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_, then instead of executing a single command, you
       will be logged in on the	remote host using _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C).

       Shell metacharacters which are not  quoted  are	interpreted  on	 local
       machine,	 while	quoted	metacharacters	are  interpreted on the	remote
       machine.	 Thus the command

	  rsh otherhost	cat remotefile >> localfile

       appends the remote file _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to the localfile _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e_, while

	  rsh otherhost	cat remotefile ">>" otherremotefile

       appends _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to _o_t_h_e_r_r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e_.

       Host names are given in the file	/etc/hosts.  Each host has  one	 stan-
       dard  name (the first name given	in the file), which is rather long and
       unambiguous, and	optionally one or more nicknames.  The host names  for
       local  machines	are  also commands in the directory /usr/hosts;	if you
       put this	directory in your search path then the rrsshh can be omitted.

       If you are using	_c_s_h(1) and put a _r_s_h(1C)  in  the  background  without
       redirecting  its	input away from	the terminal, it will block even if no
       reads are posted	by the remote command.	If no  input  is  desired  you
       should redirect the input of _r_s_h	to /dev/null using the --nn option.

       You  cannot  run	 an  interactive command (like _r_o_g_u_e(6)	or _v_i(1)); use
       _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C).

       Stop signals stop the local _r_s_h process only; this is  arguably	wrong,
       but currently hard to fix for reasons too complicated to	explain	here.
