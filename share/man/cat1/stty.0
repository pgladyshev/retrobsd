       _S_t_t_y  sets  certain I/O options on the current output terminal, placing
       its output on the diagnostic output.  With no argument, it reports  the
       speed of	the terminal and the settings of the options which are differ-
       ent from	their defaults.

       The following options are available:

       --aa	 Display everything _s_t_t_y knows.	 This has the same  effect  as
		 using the operand aallll or eevveerryytthhiinngg.  The distinction between
		 aallll and eevveerryytthhiinngg has	been removed.

       --ee	 Same a	--aa above.

       --ff	 Open and use the terminal named by  _f_i_l_e  rather  than	 using
		 standard  output.   The  file	is opened using	the O_NONBLOCK
		 flag of ooppeenn(), making	it possible to set or display settings
		 on a terminal that might otherwise block on the open.

       The following operands are special:

       aallll	   Everything _s_t_t_y knows about is printed.

       eevveerryytthhiinngg  Same	as aallll above.

       fflluusshhoouutt	   Flush  the queues for the device.  This is most useful when
		   an exiting process is stuck waiting for terminal output  to
		   drain.

       ssppeeeedd	   The terminal	speed alone is printed on the standard output.

       ssiizzee	   The	terminal  (window)  sizes  are printed on the standard
		   output, first rows and then columns.

       _O_p_e_r_a_n_d_s	are selected from the following:

       eevveenn	 allow even parity input
       --eevveenn	 disallow even parity input

       oodddd	 allow odd parity input
       --oodddd	 disallow odd parity input

       rraaww	 raw mode input	(nnoo input processing (erase, kill,  interrupt,
		 ...); parity bit passed back)
       --rraaww	 negate	raw mode

       ccooookkeedd	 same as `-raw'

       ccbbrreeaakk	 make  each  character	available  to  _r_e_a_d(2) as received; no
		 erase and kill	processing, but	all other  processing  (inter-
		 rupt, suspend,	...) is	performed
       --ccbbrreeaakk	 make  characters  available  to  _r_e_a_d	only  when  newline is
		 received

       --nnll	 allow carriage	return for new-line, and output	CR-LF for car-
		 riage return or new-line
       nnll	 accept	only new-line to end lines

       eecchhoo	 echo back every character typed
       --eecchhoo	 do not	echo characters

       ttaannddeemm	 enable	 inbound software (xon/xoff) flow control, so that the
		 system	sends out the stop character when its  internal	 queue
		 is  in	 danger	 of  overflowing on input, and sends the start
		 character when	it is ready to accept further input
       --ttaannddeemm	 disable inbound software (xon/xoff) flow control

       --ttaabbss	 replace tabs by spaces	when printing
       ttaabbss	 preserve tabs

       For the following commands which	take a character argument _c,  you  may
       also specify _c as ``undef'', to set the value to	be undefined.  A value
       of ``^x'', a 2 character	sequence, is also  interpreted	as  a  control
       character, with ``^?'' representing delete.

       eerraassee _c	 set  erase  character	to  _c (default `#', but	often reset to
		 ^H.)
       kkiillll _c	 set kill character to _c (default `@', but often reset to ^U.)
       iinnttrr _c	 set interrupt character to _c (default DEL or ^? (delete), but
		 often reset to	^C.)
       qquuiitt _c	 set quit character to _c (default control \.)
       ssttaarrtt _c	 set start character to	_c (default control Q.)
       ssttoopp _c	 set stop character to _c (default control S.)
       eeooff _c	 set end of file character to _c	(default control D.)
       bbrrkk _c	 set break character to	_c (default undefined.)	This character
		 is an additional character causing wakeup.
       ddeecc	 set all modes suitable	for Digital Equipment Corp.  operating
		 systems  users; (erase, kill, and interrupt characters	to ^?,
		 ^U, and ^C, decctlq and ``crt''.)

       00	 hang up phone line immediately
       5500 7755 111100 113344 115500 220000 330000 660000 11220000 11880000 22440000 44880000 99660000 eexxttaa eexxttbb
		 Set terminal baud rate	to  the	 number	 given,	 if  possible.
		 (These	are the	speeds supported by the	DH-11 interface).

       rroowwss _n	 The terminal size is recorded as having _n rows.

       ccoolluummnnss _n The terminal size is recorded as having _n columns.

       ccoollss _n	 is an alias for _c_o_l_u_m_n_s.

       A  teletype  driver which supports the job control processing of	_c_s_h(1)
       and more	functionality than the basic  driver  is  fully	 described  in
       _t_t_y(4).	The following options apply only to it.

       ccrrtt	 Set  options  for a CRT (crtbs, ctlecho and, if >= 1200 baud,
		 crterase and crtkill.)

       ccrrttbbss	 Echo backspaces on erase characters.

       pprrtteerraassee	 For printing terminal echo erased characters backwards	within
		 ``\'' and ``/''.

       ccrrtteerraassee	 Wipe	 out   erased	characters   with   ``backspace-space-
		 backspace.''
       --ccrrtteerraassee Leave erased characters visible; just backspace.

       ccrrttkkiillll	 Wipe out input	on like	kill ala ccrrtteerraassee.
       --ccrrttkkiillll	 Just echo line	kill character and a newline on	line kill.

       ccttlleecchhoo	 Echo control characters as ``^_x''  (and  delete  as  ``^?''.)
		 Print two backspaces following	the EOT	character (control D).
       --ccttlleecchhoo	 Control  characters  echo  as	themselves; in cooked mode EOT
		 (control-D) is	not echoed.

       ddeeccccttllqq	 After output is suspended (normally  by  ^S),	only  a	 start
		 character  (normally ^Q) will restart it.  This is compatible
		 with DEC's vendor supplied systems.
       --ddeeccccttllqq	 After output is suspended, any	character typed	 will  restart
		 it; the start character will restart output without providing
		 any input.  (This is the default.)

       ttoossttoopp	 Background jobs stop if they attempt terminal output.
       --ttoossttoopp	 Output	from background	jobs to	the terminal is	allowed.

       fflluusshhoo	 Output	is being discarded usually because user	hit control  O
		 (internal state bit).
       --fflluusshhoo	 Output	is not being discarded.

       ppeennddiinn	 Input	is  pending  after  a switch from cbreak to cooked and
		 will be re-input when a read becomes pending  or  more	 input
		 arrives (internal state bit).
       --ppeennddiinn	 Input is not pending.

       ppaassss88	 Passes	all 8 bits through on input, in	any mode.
       --ppaassss88	 Strips	the 0200 bit on	input except in	raw mode.

       mmddmmbbuuff	 Start/stop output on carrier transitions (not implemented).
       --mmddmmbbuuff	 Return	error if write attempted after carrier drops.

       lliittoouutt	 Send output characters	without	any processing.
       --lliittoouutt	 Do normal output processing, inserting	delays,	etc.

       nnoohhaanngg	 Don't send hangup signal if carrier drops.
       --nnoohhaanngg	 Send  hangup  signal  to  control  process group when carrier
		 drops.

       The following special characters	are not	normally changed.

       ssuusspp _c	 set suspend process character to _c (default control Z).
       ddssuusspp _c	 set delayed suspend process character to _c  (default  control
		 Y).
       rrpprrnntt _c	 set reprint line character to _c (default control R).
       fflluusshh _c	 set flush output character to _c (default control O).
       wweerraassee _c	 set word erase	character to _c (default	control	W).
       llnneexxtt _c	 set literal next character to _c (default control V).

       These  display  the current state of modem control.  They are only dis-
       played for actual tty lines and not for pseudo  tty  lines  (more  pre-
       cisely,	it  is	only  displayed	 for  lines which support the TIOCMGET
       ioctl.  See tty(4).
       While it	is possible to change the state	of the	modem  control	lines,
       the  hardware  or  other	 software may prevent the change from actually
       taking place, or	may cause the state to immediately revert to the orig-
       inal state.

       ddccdd (--ddccdd)     State of Data Carrier Detect.

       ddssrr (--ddssrr)     State of Data Set	Ready.

       ddttrr (--ddttrr)     State of Data Terminal Ready.

       ccttss (--ccttss)     State of Clear To	Send.
