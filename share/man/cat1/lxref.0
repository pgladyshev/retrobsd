       _L_x_r_e_f  reads cross reference file(s) written by the lisp	compiler _l_i_s_z_t
       and prints a cross reference listing on	the  standard  output.	 _L_i_s_z_t
       will  create a cross reference file during compilation when it is given
       the --xx switch.  Cross reference files usually end in  `.x'  and	conse-
       quently	_l_x_r_e_f will append a `.x' to the	file names given if necessary.
       The first option	to _l_x_r_e_f is a  decimal	integer,  N,  which  sets  the
       _i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l_.   If a function is called more than	_i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l times, the
       cross reference listing will just print the number of calls instead  of
       listing each one	of them.  The default for _i_g_n_o_r_e_l_e_v_e_l is 50.

       The  --aa	option causes _l_x_r_e_f to put limited cross reference information
       in the sources named.  _l_x_r_e_f will scan the source  and  when  it	 comes
       across a	definition of a	function (that is a line beginning with	_`_(_d_e_f_'
       it will preceed that line with a	list of	the functions which call  this
       function,  written  as  a  comment  preceeded by	_`_;_._. _' _.  All existing
       lines beginning with _`_;_._. _' will	be removed  from  the  file.   If  the
       source file contains a line beginning _`_;_._-_' then	this will disable this
       annotation process from this point on until a _`_;_._+_' is  seen  (however,
       lines  beginning	 with  _`_;_._. _' will continue to be deleted).  After the
       annoation is done, the original file _`_f_o_o_._l_' is renamed	to  _`_#_._f_o_o_._l_'_"
       and the new file	with annotation	is named _`_f_o_o_._l_'
