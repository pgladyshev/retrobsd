       _P_x  interprets  the  abstract  machine code generated by	_p_i_.  The first
       argument	is the file to be interpreted, and defaults to _o_b_j;  remaining
       arguments  are available	to the Pascal program using the	built-ins _a_r_g_v
       and _a_r_g_c_.  _P_x is	also invoked by	_p_i_x when running `load and go'.

       If the program terminates abnormally an error  message  and  a  control
       flow  backtrace	are  printed.	The  number of statements executed and
       total execution time are	 printed  after	 normal	 termination.	The  pp
       option  of  _p_i suppresses all of	this except the	message	indicating the
       cause of	abnormal termination.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Most run-time error messages are	self-explanatory.  Some	 of  the  more
       unusual ones are:

       Reference to an inactive	file
	     A file other than _i_n_p_u_t or	_o_u_t_p_u_t was used	before a call to _r_e_s_e_t
	     or	_r_e_w_r_i_t_e_.

       Statement count limit exceeded
	     The limit of 500,000 executed statements (which  prevents	exces-
	     sive looping or recursion)	has been exceeded.

       Bad data	found on integer read
       Bad data	found on real read
	     Usually,  non-numeric  input  was found for a number.  For	reals,
	     Pascal requires digits before and after the decimal point so that
	     numbers like `.1' or `21.'	evoke the second diagnostic.

       panic: _S_o_m_e _m_e_s_s_a_g_e
	     Indicates a internal inconsistency	detected in _p_x probably	due to
	     a Pascal system bug.  Charles B. Haley, William N.	Joy,  and  Ken
	     Thompson

BBUUGGSS
       Calls to	the procedures _d_i_s_p_o_s_e and _l_i_n_e_l_i_m_i_t are ignored.

       Post-mortem  traceback  is  not	limited;  infinite  recursion leads to
       almost infinite traceback.

       Because interrupts sometimes find the system in the middle of a	pprrooccee--
       dduurree  or	ffuunnccttiioonn entry or exit,	the error backtrace on an interrupt is
       occasionally meaningless.  The current line is,	however,  always  cor-
       rect;  only  the	call backtrace and the name of the current routine may
       be lost.
