       nice, nohup - run a command at low priority (_s_h only)

       _N_i_c_e  executes  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d	with  low  scheduling priority.	 If the	_n_u_m_b_e_r
       argument	is present, the	priority is incremented	(higher	 numbers  mean
       lower priorities) by that amount	up to a	limit of 20.  The default _n_u_m_-
       _b_e_r is 10.

       The super-user may run commands with priority  higher  than  normal  by
       using a negative	priority, e.g. `--10'.

       _N_o_h_u_p  executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d immune to hangup	and terminate signals from the
       controlling terminal.  The priority is incremented by 5.	 _N_o_h_u_p	should
       be invoked from the shell with `&' in order to prevent it from respond-
       ing to interrupts by or stealing	the input from	the  next  person  who
       logs in on the same terminal.

       _N_i_c_e returns the	exit status of the subject command.

BBUUGGSS
       _N_i_c_e  and  _n_o_h_u_p	are particular to _s_h(1).  If you use _c_s_h(1), then com-
       mands executed with ``&'' are automatically immune  to  hangup  signals
       while  in  the background.  There is a builtin command _n_o_h_u_p which pro-
       vides immunity from terminate, but  it  does  not  redirect  output  to
       _n_o_h_u_p_._o_u_t_.

       _N_i_c_e  is	 built	into  _c_s_h(1)  with  a  slightly	 different syntax than
       described here.	The form ``nice	+10''  nices  to  positive  nice,  and
       ``nice  -10''  can  be used by the super-user to	give a process more of
       the processor.
