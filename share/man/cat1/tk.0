       The  output  of	_t_k  is	intended  for  a  Tektronix 4014 terminal.  _T_k
       arranges	for 66 lines to	fit on the screen, divides the screen  into  _N
       columns,	 and  contributes  an eight space page offset in the (default)
       single-column case.  Tabs, spaces, and  backspaces  are	collected  and
       plotted	when  necessary.   Teletype  Model  37	half- and reverse-line
       sequences are interpreted and plotted.  At the  end  of	each  page  _t_k
       waits for a newline (empty line)	from the keyboard before continuing on
       to the next page.  In this wait state, the command !!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  will  send
       the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to the shell.

       The command line	options	are:

       --tt     Don't wait between pages;	for directing output into a file.

       --_N     Divide the screen	into _N columns and wait	after the last column.

       --pp_L    Set page length to _L lines.
