       chflags - change	file flags

       The  cchhffllaaggss  utility  modifies	the  file flags	of the listed files as
       specified by the	ffllaaggss operand.

       The options are as follows:

       -R	      Change the file flags for	the file hierarchies rooted in
		      the files	instead	of just	the files themselves.

       -f cchhffllaaggss will not complain if it fails	to change the flags on a file.

       Flags  are  a comma separated list of keywords.	The following keywords
       are currently defined:

       arch		   No  effect.	 This  bit  is	defined	 and  will  be
			   set/cleared	as requested but nothing in the	system
			   makes use of	it yet.

       dump		   Set the dump	flag

       sappnd		   Set the system append-only flag (super-user only)

       schg		   Set the system immutable flag (super-user only)

       uappnd		   Set the user	append-only flag (owner	or  super-user
			   only)

       uchg		   Set	the  user  immutable flag (owner or super-user
			   only)

       Putting the letters nnoo before an	option causes the flag	to  be	turned
       off.  For example:

       nodump		   the file should never be dumped

       Symbolic	 links	do not have flags and are silently ignored by cchhffllaaggss..
       When the	-R option is given and symbolic	links are encountered they are
       not traversed.  This is the same	behaviour as cchhmmoodd((11)).

       The cchhffllaaggss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
