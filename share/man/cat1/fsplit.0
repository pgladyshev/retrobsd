       FFsspplliitt  takes  as input either a	file or	standard input containing For-
       tran source code.  It attempts to split the input into separate routine
       files  of  the  form _n_a_m_e_._f_, where _n_a_m_e is the name of the program unit
       (e.g. function, subroutine, block  data	or  program).	The  name  for
       unnamed	block  data  subprograms has the form _b_l_k_d_t_a_N_N_N_._f where	NNN is
       three digits and	a file of this	name  does  not	 already  exist.   For
       unnamed	main programs the name has the form _m_a_i_n_N_N_N_._f_.	If there is an
       error in	classifying a program unit, or if _n_a_m_e_._f already  exists,  the
       program	unit will be put in a file of the form _z_z_z_N_N_N_._f	where _z_z_z_N_N_N_._f
       does not	already	exist.

       Normally	each subprogram	unit is	split into a separate file.  When  the
       _-_e  option  is used, only the specified subprogram units	are split into
       separate	files.	E.g.:
	    fsplit -e readit -e	doit prog.f
       will split readit and doit into separate	files.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       If names	specified via the _-_e option are	not  found,  a	diagnostic  is
       written to _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _e_r_r_o_r_.

BBUUGGSS
       _F_s_p_l_i_t  assumes	the subprogram name is on the first noncomment line of
       the subprogram unit.  Nonstandard source	formats	may confuse _f_s_p_l_i_t_.

       It is hard to use _-_e for	unnamed	main programs and block	 data  subpro-
       grams since you must predict the	created	file name.
