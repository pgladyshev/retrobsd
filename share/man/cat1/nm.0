       _N_m prints the name list (symbol table) of each object _f_i_l_e in the argu-
       ment list.  If an argument is an	archive, a  listing  for  each	object
       file in the archive will	be produced.  If no _f_i_l_e is given, the symbols
       in "a.out" are listed.

       Each symbol name	is preceded by its value (blanks if undefined) and one
       of  the letters UU (undefined), AA	(absolute), TT (text segment symbol), DD
       (data segment symbol), BB	(bss segment symbol), CC	(common	symbol), or  ff
       file name.  If the symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in
       lower case.  If the file	is an overlaid executable, the overlay	number
       is  printed  after the name.  The number	is printed if the symbol is in
       an overlay or if	it is the entry	point (in the base segment) for	a sub-
       routine in an overlay.  The output is sorted alphabetically.

       Options are:

       --gg     Print only global	(external) symbols.

       --nn     Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

       --oo     Prepend  file or archive element name to each output line	rather
	      than only	once.

       --pp     Don't sort; print	in symbol-table	order.

       --rr     Sort in reverse order.

       --uu     Print only undefined symbols.
