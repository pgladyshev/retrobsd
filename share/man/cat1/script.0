DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _S_c_r_i_p_t  makes a typescript of everything	printed	on your	terminal.  The
       typescript is written to	_f_i_l_e, or appended to _f_i_l_e if the --aa option  is
       given.	It can be sent to the line printer later with _l_p_r.  If no file
       name is given, the typescript is	saved in the file _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t.

       The script ends when the	forked shell exits.

       This program is useful when using a crt and a hard-copy record  of  the
       dialog  is  desired,  as	 for  a	 student handing in a program that was
       developed on a crt when hard-copy terminals are in short	supply.

BBUUGGSS
       _S_c_r_i_p_t places eevveerryytthhiinngg	in the log file.  This is not what  the	 naive
       user expects.
