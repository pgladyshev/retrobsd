       _F_i_l_e_1  is  copied  onto _f_i_l_e_2.  By default, the mode and	owner of _f_i_l_e_2
       are preserved if	it already existed; otherwise the mode of  the	source
       file modified by	the current _u_m_a_s_k(2) is	used.  The --pp option causes _c_p
       to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies	the modification times
       and modes of the	source files, ignoring the present _u_m_a_s_k.

       In  the	second	form,  one or more _f_i_l_e_s are copied into the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
       with their original file-names.

       _C_p refuses to copy a file onto itself.

       If the --ii option	is specified, _c_p will prompt the user with the name of
       the file	whenever the copy will cause an	old file to be overwritten. An
       answer of 'y' will cause	_c_p to continue.	Any other answer will  prevent
       it from overwriting the file.

       If  the --rr option is specified and any of the source files are directo-
       ries, _c_p	copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case the des-
       tination	must be	a directory.
