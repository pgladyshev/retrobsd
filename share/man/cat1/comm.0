       _C_o_m_m  reads _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2_, which should be ordered in ASCII collating
       sequence, and produces a	three column  output:  lines  only  in	_f_i_l_e_1_;
       lines  only  in _f_i_l_e_2_; and lines	in both	files.	The filename `-' means
       the standard input.

       Flags 1,	2, or 3	suppress printing of the corresponding	column.	  Thus
       ccoommmm --1122	prints only the	lines common to	the two	files; ccoommmm --2233	prints
       only lines in the first file but	not in the second; ccoommmm	--112233 is	a  no-
       op.
