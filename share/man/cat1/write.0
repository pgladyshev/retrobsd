       write - write to	another	user

       _W_r_i_t_e  copies  lines  from your terminal	to that	of another user.  When
       first called, it	sends the message

	    Message from yourname@yoursystem on	yourttyname at time...

       The recipient of	the message should write back at this point.  Communi-
       cation  continues  until	an end of file is read from the	terminal or an
       interrupt is sent.  At that point _w_r_i_t_e writes `EOT' on the other  ter-
       minal and exits.

       If  you	want  to  write	to a user who is logged	in more	than once, the
       _t_t_y_n_a_m_e argument	may be used to indicate	the appropriate	terminal name.

       Permission to write may be denied or granted by use of  the  _m_e_s_g  com-
       mand.  At the outset writing is allowed.	 Certain commands, in particu-
       lar _n_r_o_f_f and _p_r(1) disallow messages in	order to prevent messy output.

       If the character	`!' is found at	the beginning of a line,  _w_r_i_t_e	 calls
       the shell to execute the	rest of	the line as a command.

       The  following  protocol	 is  suggested for using _w_r_i_t_e:	when you first
       write to	another	user, wait for him to write back  before  starting  to
       send.   Each  party  should  end	 each  message with a distinctive sig-
       nal--((oo))	for `over' is conventional--that the other  may	 reply.	  ((oooo))
       for `over and out' is suggested when conversation is about to be	termi-
       nated.
