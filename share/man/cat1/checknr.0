       _C_h_e_c_k_n_r checks a	list of	_n_r_o_f_f(1) or _t_r_o_f_f(1) input files  for  certain
       kinds of	errors involving mismatched opening and	closing	delimiters and
       unknown commands.  If no	files are specified, _c_h_e_c_k_n_r checks the	 stan-
       dard input.  Delimeters checked are:

       (1)    Font changes using \fx ... \fP.

       (2)    Size changes using \sx ... \s0.

       (3)    Macros  that  come in open ... close forms, for example, the .TS
	      and .TE macros which must	always come in pairs.

       _C_h_e_c_k_n_r knows about the _m_s(7) and _m_e(7) macro packages.

       Additional pairs	of macros can be  added	 to  the  list	using  the  --aa
       option.	 This must be followed by groups of six	characters, each group
       defining	a pair of macros.  The six characters are a period, the	 first
       macro name, another period, and the second macro	name.  For example, to
       define a	pair .BS and .ES, use -aa.BS.ES

       The --cc option defines commands  which  would  otherwise	be  complained
       about as	undefined.

       The --ff option requests _c_h_e_c_k_n_r to ignore	\f font	changes.

       The --ss option requests _c_h_e_c_k_n_r to ignore	\s size	changes.

       _C_h_e_c_k_n_r	is  intended  to  be  used on documents	that are prepared with
       _c_h_e_c_k_n_r in mind,	much the same as _l_i_n_t_.	It expects a certain  document
       writing	style  for \f and \s commands, in that each \fx	must be	termi-
       nated with \fP and each \sx must	be terminated with \s0.	 While it will
       work to directly	go into	the next font or explicitly specify the	origi-
       nal font	or point size, and many	existing documents actually  do	 this,
       such  a	practice  will	produce	 complaints from _c_h_e_c_k_n_r_.  Since it is
       probably	better to use the \fP and \s0 forms anyway, you	 should	 think
       of this as a contribution to your document preparation style.

       Complaints about	unmatched delimiters.
       Complaints about	unrecognized commands.
       Various complaints about	the syntax of commands.

       There is	no way to define a 1 character macro name using	--aa.
       Does  not  correctly  recognize	certain	reasonable constructs, such as
       conditionals.
