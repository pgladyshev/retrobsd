       mv - move or rename files

       mmvv [ --ii ] [ --ff ]	[ -- ] file1 file2

       mmvv [ --ii ] [ --ff ]	[ -- ] file ... directory

       _M_v moves	(changes the name of) _f_i_l_e_1 to _f_i_l_e_2.

       If _f_i_l_e_2	already	exists,	it is removed before _f_i_l_e_1 is moved.  If _f_i_l_e_2
       has a mode which	forbids	writing, _m_v prints the mode (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)) and
       reads  the  standard input to obtain a line; if the line	begins with yy,,
       the move	takes place; if	not, _m_v	exits.

       In the second form, one or more _f_i_l_e_s (plain files or directories)  are
       moved to	the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y with their original file-names.

       _M_v refuses to move a file onto itself.

       Options:

       --ii     stands  for interactive mode. Whenever a move is to supercede an
	      existing file, the user is prompted by the name of the file fol-
	      lowed  by	 a  question  mark. If he answers with a line starting
	      with 'y',	the move continues. Any	other reply prevents the  move
	      from occurring.

       --ff     stands for force.	This option overrides any mode restrictions or
	      the -i switch.

       --      means interpret all the following	arguments to _m_v	as file	names.
	      This allows file names starting with minus.

       cp(1), ln(1)

BBUUGGSS
       If _f_i_l_e_1	and _f_i_l_e_2 lie on different file	systems, _m_v must copy the file
       and delete the original.	 In this case the owner	name becomes  that  of
       the  copying  process  and any linking relationship with	other files is
       lost.
