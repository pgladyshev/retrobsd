DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _T_a_i_l copies the named file to the standard output beginning at a	desig-
       nated place.  If	no file	is named, the standard input is	used.

       Copying begins at distance _+_n_u_m_b_e_r from the beginning, or _-_n_u_m_b_e_r  from
       the  end	 of the	input.	_N_u_m_b_e_r is counted in units of lines, blocks or
       characters, according to	the appended option ll,, bb or cc..	When no	 units
       are specified, counting is by lines.

       Specifying  rr  causes  tail  to print lines from	the end	of the file in
       reverse order.  The default for rr is to print the entire	file this way.
       Specifying  ff  causes  _t_a_i_l to not quit at end of file, but rather wait
       and try to read repeatedly in hopes that	the file will grow.

BBUUGGSS
       Tails relative to the end of the	file are treasured up in a buffer, and
       thus are	limited	in length.

       Various	kinds  of anomalous behavior may happen	with character special
       files.
