       The  file  _s_y_m_l_i_s_t  contains a list of symbols to be found in _f_i_l_e_, one
       symbol per line.

       The symbol table	of _f_i_l_e	is updated in place; symbols read from _s_y_m_l_i_s_t
       are relocated to	the beginning of the table and in the order given.

       getting symbols from the	kernel name list.
