       _S_u  demands  the	 password of the specified _u_s_e_r_i_d_, and if it is	given,
       changes to that _u_s_e_r_i_d and invokes the Shell _s_h(1)  or  _c_s_h(1)  without
       changing	 the  current  directory.   The	 user environment is unchanged
       except for HOME and SHELL, which	are taken from the password  file  for
       the  user being substituted (see	_e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7)).  The new user ID stays in
       force until the Shell exits.

       If no _u_s_e_r_i_d is specified, ``root'' is  assumed.	  Only	users  in  the
       ``wheel''  group	(group 0) can _s_u to ``root'', even with	the root pass-
       word.  To remind	the super-user of his responsibilities,	the Shell sub-
       stitutes	`#' for	its usual prompt.

       The --ff option prevents _c_s_h(1) from executing the	.cshrc file; thus mak-
       ing _s_u start up faster.

       The -- option simulates a	full login.
