       _V_m_s_t_a_t  delves  into the	system and normally reports certain statistics
       kept about process, virtual memory, disk, trap and  cpu	activity.   If
       given  a	 --ff  argument,	it  instead reports on the number of _f_o_r_k_s and
       _v_f_o_r_k_s since system startup and the number of pages of  virtual	memory
       involved	 in  each  kind	 of  fork.  If given a --ss argument, it instead
       prints the contents of the _s_u_m structure, giving	the  total  number  of
       several	kinds of paging	related	events which have occurred since boot.
       If given	a --ii argument, it instead reports on the number	of  _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_s
       taken by	each device since system startup.

       If  none	 of  these  options are	given, _v_m_s_t_a_t will report in the first
       line a summary of the virtual memory activity since the system has been
       booted.	 If _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l is	specified, then	successive lines are summaries
       over the	last _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds.	``vmstat 5'' will print	what the  sys-
       tem  is	doing  every  five  seconds; this is a good choice of printing
       interval	since this is how often	some of	the statistics are sampled  in
       the  system;  others  vary every	second,	running	the output for a while
       will make it apparent which are recomputed every	second.	 If a _c_o_u_n_t is
       given, the statistics are repeated _c_o_u_n_t	times.	The format fields are:

       Procs: information about	numbers	of processes in	various	states.

       r    in run queue
       b    blocked for	resources (i/o,	paging,	etc.)
       w    runnable or	short sleeper (< 20 secs) but swapped

       Memory:	information  about the usage of	virtual	and real memory.  Vir-
       tual pages are considered active	if they	belong to processes which  are
       running	or  have  run in the last 20 seconds.  A ``page'' here is 1024
       bytes.

       avm  active virtual pages
       fre  size of the	free list

       Page: information about page faults and	paging	activity.   These  are
       averaged	each five seconds, and given in	units per second.

       re   page reclaims (simulating reference	bits)
       at   pages attached (found in free list)
       pi   pages paged	in
       po   pages paged	out
       fr   pages freed	per second
       de   anticipated	short term memory shortfall
       sr   pages scanned by clock algorithm, per-second

       up/hp/rk/ra:  Disk  operations  per second (this	field is system	depen-
       dent).  Typically paging	will be	split across several of	the  available
       drives.	The number under each of these is the unit number.

       Faults: trap/interrupt rate averages per	second over last 5 seconds.

       in   (non clock)	device interrupts per second
       sy   system calls per second
       cs   cpu	context	switch rate (switches/sec)

       Cpu: breakdown of percentage usage of CPU time

       us   user time for normal and low priority processes
       sy   system time
       id   cpu	idle

       If  more	 than  4 disk drives are configured in the system, _v_m_s_t_a_t dis-
       plays only the first 4 drives, with  priority  given  to	 Massbus  disk
       drives  (i.e.  if  both	Unibus	and Massbus drives are present and the
       total number of drives exceeds 4, then some  number  of	Unibus	drives
       will not	be displayed in	favor of the Massbus drives).  To force	_v_m_s_t_a_t
       to display specific drives, their names may be supplied on the  command
       line.
