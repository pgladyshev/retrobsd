       _C_o_l  reads  the standard	input and writes the standard output.  It per-
       forms the line overlays implied by reverse line feeds (ESC-7 in	ASCII)
       and  by	forward	and reverse half line feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8).	_C_o_l is
       particularly useful for filtering  multicolumn  output  made  with  the
       `.rt' command of	_n_r_o_f_f and output resulting from	use of the _t_b_l(1) pre-
       processor.

       Although	_c_o_l accepts half line motions in its input, it	normally  does
       not emit	them on	output.	 Instead, text that would appear between lines
       is moved	to the next lower full line boundary.  This treatment  can  be
       suppressed  by  the  --ff (fine) option; in this case the output from _c_o_l
       may contain forward half	line feeds (ESC-9), but	will still never  con-
       tain either kind	of reverse line	motion.

       If the --bb option	is given, _c_o_l assumes that the output device in	use is
       not capable of backspacing.  In this case, if several characters	are to
       appear in the same place, only the last one read	will be	taken.

       The control characters SO (ASCII	code 017), and SI (016)	are assumed to
       start and end text in an	alternate character set.   The	character  set
       (primary	 or alternate) associated with each printing character read is
       remembered; on output, SO and SI	characters are generated where	neces-
       sary to maintain	the correct treatment of each character.

       If  the --hh option is given, _c_o_l converts	white space to tabs to shorten
       printing	time.

       All control  characters	are  removed  from  the	 input	except	space,
       backspace,  tab,	return,	newline, ESC (033) followed by one of 7, 8, 9,
       SI, SO, and VT (013).  This last	character is an	alternate form of full
       reverse	line  feed, for	compatibility with some	other hardware conven-
       tions.  All other non-printing characters are ignored.
