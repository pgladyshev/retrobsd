       _P_m_e_r_g_e  assembles  the named Pascal files into a	single standard	Pascal
       program.	 The resulting program is listed on the	standard  output.   It
       is  intended  to	 be  used to merge a collection	of separately compiled
       modules so that they can	be run through	ppii  ,  or  exported  to	 other
       sites.

       Very minimal error checking is done, so incorrect programs will produce
       unpredictable results.  Block comments should be	placed after the  key-
       word  to	 which	they  refer  or	 they  are likely to end up in bizarre
       places.
