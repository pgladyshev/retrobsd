       _S_p_l_i_t reads _f_i_l_e	and writes it in _n-line	pieces (default	1000), as many
       as necessary, onto a set	of output files.  The name of the first	output
       file is _n_a_m_e with aaaa appended, and so on	lexicographically.  If no out-
       put name	is given, xx is default.

       If no input file	is given, or if	-- is given  in	its  stead,  then  the
       standard	input file is used.
