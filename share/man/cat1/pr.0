       _P_r produces a printed listing of	one or more _f_i_l_e_s_.  The	output is sep-
       arated into pages headed	by a date, the name of the file	or a specified
       header, and the page number.  If	there are no file arguments, _p_r	prints
       its standard input.

       Options apply to	all following files but	may be reset between files:

       --_n     Produce _n-column output.

       ++_n     Begin printing with page _n_.

       --hh     Take the next argument as	a page header.

       --ww_n    For purposes of multi-column output, take	the width of the  page
	      to be _n characters instead of the	default	72.

       --ff     Use formfeeds instead of newlines	to separate pages.  A formfeed
	      is assumed to use	up two blank lines  at	the  top  of  a	 page.
	      (Thus this option	does not affect	the effective page length.)

       --ll_n    Take the length of the page to be	_n lines	instead	of the default
	      66.

       --tt     Do not print the 5-line header or	the  5-line  trailer  normally
	      supplied for each	page.

       --ss_c    Separate	columns	 by  the  single character _c instead of	by the
	      appropriate amount of white space.  A missing _c is taken to be a
	      tab.

       --mm     Print all	_f_i_l_e_s simultaneously, each in one column,

       Inter-terminal messages via _w_r_i_t_e(1) are	forbidden during a _p_r.

       There are no diagnostics	when _p_r	is printing on a terminal.
