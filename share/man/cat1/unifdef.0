       _U_n_i_f_d_e_f	is useful for removing ifdef'ed	lines from a file while	other-
       wise leaving the	file alone.  _U_n_i_f_d_e_f is	like a	stripped-down  C  pre-
       processor: it is	smart enough to	deal with the nested ifdefs, comments,
       single and double quotes	of C syntax so that it can do its job, but  it
       doesn't	do any including or interpretation of macros.  Neither does it
       strip out comments, though it recognizes	and ignores them.  You specify
       which  symbols  you want	defined	--DD_s_y_m or undefined --UU_s_y_m and the lines
       inside those ifdefs will	be copied to the output	or removed  as	appro-
       priate.	 The  ifdef, ifndef, else, and endif lines associated with _s_y_m
       will also be removed.  Ifdefs involving symbols you don't  specify  are
       untouched  and  copied out along	with their associated ifdef, else, and
       endif lines.  If	an ifdef X occurs nested inside	another	ifdef X,  then
       the  inside  ifdef is treated as	if it were an unrecognized symbol.  If
       the same	symbol appears in more	than  one  argument,  only  the	 first
       occurrence is significant.

       The  --ll option causes _u_n_i_f_d_e_f to	replace	removed	lines with blank lines
       instead of deleting them.

       If you use ifdefs to delimit non-C lines,  such	as  comments  or  code
       which  is  under	construction, then you must tell _u_n_i_f_d_e_f which symbols
       are used	for that purpose so that it won't try to parse for quotes  and
       comments	 in those ifdef'ed lines.  You specify that you	want the lines
       inside certain ifdefs to	be ignored but	copied	out  with  --iidd_s_y_m  and
       --iiuu_s_y_m similar to --DD_s_y_m and --UU_s_y_m above.

       If  you	want  to  use  _u_n_i_f_d_e_f for plain text (not C code), use	the --tt
       option.	This makes _u_n_i_f_d_e_f refrain from	attempting to  recognize  com-
       ments and single	and double quotes.

       _U_n_i_f_d_e_f	copies its output to _s_t_d_o_u_t and	will take its input from _s_t_d_i_n
       if no _f_i_l_e argument is given.  If the --cc	argument  is  specified,  then
       the  operation  of  _u_n_i_f_d_e_f  is complemented, i.e. the lines that would
       have been removed or blanked are	retained and vice versa.
