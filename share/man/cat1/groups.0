       The  ggrroouuppss  utility  has  been	obsoleted by the id(1) utility,	and is
       equivalent to ``iidd --GGnn [_u_s_e_r]''.	 The command
       ``iidd --pp'' is suggested for normal interactive use.

       The ggrroouuppss utility displays the groups to which you (or the  optionally
       specified user) belong.

       The ggrroouuppss utility exits	0 on success, and >0 if	an error occurs.
