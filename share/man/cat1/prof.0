       _P_r_o_f interprets the file	produced by  the  _m_o_n_i_t_o_r  subroutine.	 Under
       default	modes,	the  symbol  table  in	the  named  object file	_(_a_._o_u_t
       default)	 is  read  and	correlated  with  the  profile	file  _(_m_o_n_._o_u_t
       default).   For each external symbol, the percentage of time spent exe-
       cuting between that symbol and  the  next  is  printed  (in  decreasing
       order),	together  with the number of times that	routine	was called and
       the number of milliseconds per call.  If	more than one profile file  is
       specified, the output represents	the sum	of the profiles.

       In  order  for  the  number of calls to a routine to be tallied,	the --pp
       option of _c_c_, _f_7_7 or _p_c must have been given when the  file  containing
       the  routine  was  compiled.  This option also arranges for the profile
       file to be produced automatically.

       Options are:

       --aa     all symbols are reported rather than just	external symbols.

       --ll     the output is sorted by symbol value.

       --nn     the output is sorted by number of	calls

       --ss     a	summary	profile	file is	produced in _m_o_n_._s_u_m_.  This  is	really
	      only useful when more than one profile file is specified.

       --vv     all  printing is suppressed and a	graphic	version	of the profile
	      is produced on the standard output for display  by  the  _p_l_o_t(1)
	      filters.	 When plotting,	the numbers _l_o_w	and _h_i_g_h_, by default 0
	      and 100, may be given to cause a selected	percentage of the pro-
	      file to be plotted with accordingly higher resolution.

       --zz     routines	which have zero	usage (as indicated by call counts and
	      accumulated time)	are nevertheless printed in the	output.

       tines and functions.
