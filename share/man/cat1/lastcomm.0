       _L_a_s_t_c_o_m_m	gives information on previously	executed commands.

       Option:


       -f _f_i_l_e	 Read from _f_i_l_e	rather than the	default	accounting file.

       With no arguments, _l_a_s_t_c_o_m_m prints information about all	 the  commands
       recorded	during the current accounting file's lifetime.	If called with
       arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command  name,  user
       name, or	terminal name are printed.  So,	for example,

	    lastcomm a.out root	ttyd0

       would  produce  a listing of all	the executions of commands named _a_._o_u_t
       by user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

       For each	process	entry, the following are printed.

	    The	name of	the user who ran the process.
	    Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the system.
	    The	command	name under which the process was called.
	    The	amount of cpu time used	by the process (in seconds).
	    The	time the process exited.

       The flags are encoded as	follows: ``S'' indicates the command was  exe-
       cuted  by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after a fork,
       but without a following _e_x_e_c, ``C'' indicates the command  was  run  in
       PDP-11  compatibility mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command ter-
       minated with the	generation of a	_c_o_r_e file,  and	 ``X''	indicates  the
       command was terminated with a signal.

FFIILLEESS
       /usr/adm/acct	   Default accounting file.
