       _D_i_c_t_i_o_n	finds  all sentences in	a document that	contain	phrases	from a
       data base of bad	or wordy diction.  Each	phrase is bracketed with [  ].
       Because	_d_i_c_t_i_o_n	 runs  _d_e_r_o_f_f  before  looking at the text, formatting
       header files should be included as part	of  the	 input.	  The  default
       macro  package  --mmss  may	be overridden with the flag --mmmm..  The flag --mmll
       which causes ddeerrooffff to skip lists, should be used if the	document  con-
       tains  many  lists  of  non-sentences.  The user	may supply her/his own
       pattern file to be used in addition to the default file with --ff	_p_f_i_l_e_.
       If the flag --nn is also supplied the default file	will be	suppressed.

       _E_x_p_l_a_i_n is an interactive thesaurus for the phrases found by diction.

       Use  of	non-standard  formatting  macros  may cause incorrect sentence
       breaks.	In particular, _d_i_c_t_i_o_n doesn't grok --mmee..
