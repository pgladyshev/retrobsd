       _V_w_i_d_t_h  translates from the width information stored in the vfont style
       format to the format expected by	troff.	Troff wants an object file  in
       a.out(5)	 format.  (This	fact does not seem to be documented anywhere.)
       Troff should look directly in the font file but it doesn't.

       Vwidth should be	used after editing a font with _f_e_d_(_1_)_.	It is not nec-
       essary  to  use	vwidth unless you have made a change that would	affect
       the width tables.  Such changes include numerically editing  the	 width
       field,  adding  a new character,	and moving or copying a	character to a
       new position.  It is _n_o_t	always necessary to use	vwidth if the physical
       width  of  the glyph (e.g. the number of	columns	in the bit matrix) has
       changed,	but if it has changed much the logical width  should  probably
       be changed and vwidth run.

       Vwidth  produces	 a  C  program	on  its	standard output.  This program
       should be run through the C compiler and	the object (that  is,  the  .o
       file) saved.  The resulting file	should be placed in /usr/share/font in
       the file	ft_x_x where is a	one or two letter code	that  is  the  logical
       (internal  to  troff)  font name.  This name can	be found by looking in
       the file	/usr/share/fontinfo/_f_n_a_m_e* where _f_n_a_m_e is the external name of
       the font.
