       The  uunnaammee  command writes the name of the operating system implementa-
       tion to standard	output.	 When options are  specified,  strings	repre-
       senting one or more system characteristics are written to standard out-
       put.

       The options are as follows:

       -a	 Behave	as though the options -m, -n, -r ,  -s,	 and  -v  were
		 specified.

       -m	 Write	the  type of the current hardware platform to standard
		 output.

       -n	 Write the name	of the system to standard output.

       -r	 Write the current release level of the	 operating  system  to
		 standard output.

       -s	 Write	the  name  of  the  operating system implementation to
		 standard output.

       -v	 Write the version level of this release of the	operating sys-
		 tem to	standard output.

       If  the -a flag is specified, or	multiple flags are specified, all out-
       put is written on a single line,	separated by spaces.
