       _W_c  counts  lines,  words  and characters in the	named files, or	in the
       standard	input if no name appears.  A word is a maximal string of char-
       acters delimited	by spaces, tabs	or newlines.

       If  an argument beginning with one of ``lwc'' is	present, the specified
       counts (lines, words, or	characters) are	selected by the	letters	ll,  ww,
       or cc.  The default is --llwwcc.
