       _A_p_r_o_p_o_s	shows  which  manual  sections contain instances of any	of the
       given keywords in their title.  Each word is considered separately  and
       case  of	 letters  is ignored.  Words which are part of other words are
       considered; thus, when looking  for  compile,  _a_p_r_o_p_o_s  will  find  all
       instances of `compiler' also.  Try

	      apropos password

       and

	      apropos editor

       If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do `man section name' to
       get the documentation for it.  Try `apropos format' and	then  `man  3s
       printf' to get the manual on the	subroutine _p_r_i_n_t_f_.

       _A_p_r_o_p_o_s is actually just	the --kk option to the _m_a_n(1) command.
