       _A_t spools away a	copy of	the named _f_i_l_e to be used as input to _s_h(1) or
       _c_s_h(1).	If the --cc flag (for _(_c_s_h(1))) or the --ss	flag (for _(_s_h(1)))  is
       specified, then that shell will be used to execute the job; if no shell
       is specified, the current environment shell is used.  If	no  file  name
       is specified, _a_t	prompts	for commands from standard input until a ^D is
       typed.

       If the --mm flag is specified, mail will be sent to the  user  after  the
       job  has	 been run. If errors occur during execution of the job,	then a
       copy of the error diagnostics will be sent to the user.	If  no	errors
       occur,  then  a short message is	sent informing the user	that no	errors
       occurred.

       The format of the spool file is as follows: A  four  line  header  that
       includes	 the  owner of the job,	the name of the	job, the shell used to
       run the job, and	whether	mail will be set after the  job	 is  executed.
       The  header  is followed	by a _c_d	command	to the current directory and a
       _u_m_a_s_k command to	set the	modes on any files created by the  job.	  Then
       _a_t  copies  all relevant	environment variables to the spool file.  When
       the script is run, it uses the user and group ID	of the creator of  the
       spool file.

       The  _t_i_m_e is 1 to 4 digits, with	an optional following `A', `P',	`N' or
       `M' for AM, PM, noon or midnight.  One and two digit numbers are	 taken
       to be hours, three and four digits to be	hours and minutes.  If no let-
       ters follow the digits, a 24 hour clock time is understood.

       The optional _d_a_y	is either (1) a	month name followed by a  day  number,
       or  (2)	a  day	of the week; if	the word `week'	follows, invocation is
       moved seven days	further	off.  Names of months and days may  be	recog-
       nizably truncated.  Examples of legitimate commands are

	      at 8am jan 24
	      at -c -m 1530 fr week
	      at -s -m 1200n week

       _A_t   programs  are  executed  by	 periodic  execution  of  the  command
       /usr/libexec/atrun from _c_r_o_n(8).	 The granularity of  _a_t	 depends  upon
       the how often atrun is executed.

       Error  output is	lost unless redirected or the _-_m flag is requested, in
       which case a copy of the	errors is sent to the user via _m_a_i_l(1).

       Complains about various syntax errors and times out of range.

BBUUGGSS
       Due to the granularity of the execution	of  _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_e_x_e_c_/_a_t_r_u_n_,	 there
       may  be	bugs  in  scheduling  things  almost exactly 24	hours into the
       future.

       If the system crashes, mail is not sent to the user informing them that
       the job was not completed.

       Sometimes   old	 spool	files  are  not	 removed  from	the  directory
       /usr/spool/at/past. This	is usually due to a system crash, and requires
       that they be removed by hand.
