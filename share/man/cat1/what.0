DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _W_h_a_t reads each file and	searches for sequences of the form ``@(#)'' as
       inserted	by the source code control system.  It then prints the remain-
       der of the string after this marker, up to a null  character,  newline,
       double quote, or	``>'' character.

BBUUGGSS
       As  SCCS	 is  not licensed with UNIX/32V, this is a rewrite of the _w_h_a_t
       command which is	part of	SCCS, and may not behave exactly the  same  as
       that command does.
