       _T_a_r  saves and restores multiple	files on a single file (usually	a mag-
       netic tape, but it can be any file).  _T_a_r's actions are	controlled  by
       the _k_e_y argument.  The _k_e_y is a string of characters containing at most
       one function letter and possibly	one or more function modifiers.	 Other
       arguments  to _t_a_r are file or directory names specifying	which files to
       dump or restore.	 In all	cases, appearance of a directory  name	refers
       to the files and	(recursively) subdirectories of	that directory.

       The  function  portion  of the key is specified by one of the following
       letters:

       rr       The named files are written on the end  of  the	tape.	The  cc
	       function	implies	this.

       xx       The named files are extracted from the tape.  If	the named file
	       matches a directory whose contents had been  written  onto  the
	       tape,  this  directory  is (recursively)	extracted.  The	owner,
	       modification time, and mode are restored	(if possible).	If  no
	       file  argument  is  given,  the	entire	content	of the tape is
	       extracted.  Note	that if	multiple entries specifying  the  same
	       file are	on the tape, the last one overwrites all earlier.

       tt       The  names  of  the  specified  files are listed	each time they
	       occur on	the tape.  If no file argument is given,  all  of  the
	       names on	the tape are listed.

       uu       The  named  files  are added to the tape	if either they are not
	       already there or	have been modified since last put on the tape.

       cc       Create a	new tape; writing begins on the	beginning of the  tape
	       instead of after	the last file.	This command implies rr.

       The  following  characters  may be used in addition to the letter which
       selects the function desired.

       oo	 On output, tar	normally places	information  specifying	 owner
		 and  modes of directories in the archive.  Former versions of
		 tar, when encountering	this information will give error  mes-
		 sage of the form
		      "<name>/:	cannot create".
		 This modifier will suppress the directory information.

       pp	 This  modifier	says to	restore	files to their original	modes,
		 ignoring the present _u_m_a_s_k(2).	 Setuid	and sticky information
		 will also be restored to the super-user.

       00,, ......,, 99 This modifier selects an alternate drive on which the tape is
		 mounted.  The default is drive	0 at 1600 bpi, which  is  nor-
		 mally /dev/rmt8.

       vv	 Normally  _t_a_r does its	work silently.	The vv (verbose)	option
		 makes _t_a_r print the name of each file it treats  preceded  by
		 the function letter.  With the	tt function, the	verbose	option
		 gives more information	about the tape entries than just their
		 names.

       ww	 _T_a_r prints the	action to be taken followed by file name, then
		 wait for user confirmation. If	a word beginning with  `y'  is
		 given,	the action is done. Any	other input means don't	do it.

       ff	 _T_a_r uses the next argument as the name	of the archive instead
		 of /dev/rmt?. If the name of the file is `-', tar  writes  to
		 standard  output  or  reads from standard input, whichever is
		 appropriate. Thus, _t_a_r	can be used as the head	or tail	 of  a
		 filter	 chain.	 _T_a_r can also be used to move hierarchies with
		 the command
			 cd fromdir; tar cf - .	| (cd todir; tar xf -)

       bb	 _T_a_r uses the next argument as the blocking  factor  for  tape
		 records.  The default is 20 (the maximum). This option	should
		 only be used with raw magnetic	tape archives (See  ff  above).
		 The block size	is determined automatically when reading tapes
		 (key letters `x' and `t').

       ll	 tells _t_a_r to complain if it cannot resolve all	of  the	 links
		 to the	files dumped.  If this is not specified, no error mes-
		 sages are printed.

       mm	 tells _t_a_r not to restore the modification times.  The modifi-
		 cation	time will be the time of extraction.

       hh	 Force	_t_a_r  to	 follow	 symbolic links	as if they were	normal
		 files or directories.	Normally, _t_a_r does not follow symbolic
		 links.

       BB	 Forces	 input	and  output  blocking to 20 blocks per record.
		 This option was added so that _t_a_r can work across a  communi-
		 cations channel where the blocking may	not be maintained.

       CC	 If  a	file  name  is preceded	by --CC, then _t_a_r	will perform a
		 _c_h_d_i_r(2) to that file name.  This allows multiple directories
		 not  related  by  a  close common parent to be	archived using
		 short relative	path names.  For  example,  to	archive	 files
		 from /usr/include and from /etc, one might use
		      tar c -C /usr include -C / etc

       Previous	 restrictions  dealing with _t_a_r's inability to properly	handle
       blocked archives	have been lifted.

       Complaints about	bad key	characters and tape read/write errors.
       Complaints if enough memory is not available to hold the	link tables.

BBUUGGSS
       There is	no way to ask for the _n-th occurrence of a file.
       Tape errors are handled ungracefully.
       The uu option can	be slow.
       The current limit on file name length is	100 characters.
       There is	no way selectively to follow symbolic links.
       When extracting tapes created with the rr	or uu options, directory	 modi-
       fication	times may not be set correctly.
