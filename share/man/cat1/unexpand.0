       _E_x_p_a_n_d  processes  the  named  files  or	the standard input writing the
       standard	output with tabs changed into  blanks.	 Backspace  characters
       are  preserved  into  the output	and decrement the column count for tab
       calculations.  _E_x_p_a_n_d is	 useful	 for  pre-processing  character	 files
       (before sorting,	looking	at specific columns, etc.) that	contain	tabs.

       If a single _t_a_b_s_t_o_p argument is given, then tabs	are set	_t_a_b_s_t_o_p	spaces
       apart instead of	the default 8.	If multiple tabstops  are  given  then
       the tabs	are set	at those specific columns.

       _U_n_e_x_p_a_n_d	 puts  tabs  back into the data	from the standard input	or the
       named files and writes the result on the	standard output.  By  default,
       only  leading  blanks  and  tabs	 are reconverted to maximal strings of
       tabs.  If the --aa	option is given, then tabs are inserted	whenever  they
       would compress the resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
