       _M_t  is  used to give commands to	a magnetic tape	drive.	If a tape name
       is not specified, the environment variable TAPE is used;	 if TAPE  does
       not exist, _m_t uses the device _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_t_1_2.  Note that _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e must ref-
       erence a	raw (not block)	tape  device.	By  default  _m_t	 performs  the
       requested  operation  once.  Operations may be performed	multiple times
       by specifying _c_o_u_n_t.

       The available commands are listed below.	 Only as  many	characters  as
       are required to uniquely	identify a command need	be specified.

       eeooff, wweeooff
	      Write  _c_o_u_n_t  end-of-file	 marks	at the current position	on the
	      tape.

       ffssff    Forward space _c_o_u_n_t files.

       ffssrr    Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

       bbssff    Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.

       bbssrr    Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

       rreewwiinndd Rewind the tape (_C_o_u_n_t is	ignored).

       oofffflliinnee,	rreewwooffffll
	      Rewind the tape and place	 the  tape  unit  off-line  (_C_o_u_n_t  is
	      ignored).

       ssttaattuuss Print status information about the tape unit.

       ccaacchheeoonn
	      Enable the readahead/writebehind cache on	the tape unit.

       ccaacchheeooffff
	      Turn off the readahead/writebehind cache on the tape unit.

       _M_t  returns a 0 exit status when	the operation(s) were successful, 1 if
       the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.

       The ccaacchheeoonn and ccaacchheeooffff	commands currently only	 apply	to  the	 TMSCP
       driver and then only for	certain	drives such as the TU81+.  No error is
       produced	by the TMSCP driver if the cache  commands  are	 used.	 Other
       drivers	will  return  an  error	 code  since they do not recognize the
       MMTTCCAACCHHEE and MMTTNNOOCCAACCHHEE functions codes.  See mmttiioo(4).
