       _A_t_r_m removes jobs that were created with	the _a_t(1) command.  With the --
       flag, all jobs belonging	to the person invoking _a_t_r_m are	removed.  If a
       job  number(s) is specified, _a_t_r_m attempts to remove only that job num-
       ber(s).

       If the --ff flag is used, all information regarding the  removal  of  the
       specified  jobs	is suppressed.	If the --ii flag is used,	_a_t_r_m asks if a
       job should be removed; a	response of 'y'	causes the job to be removed.

       If a user(s) name is specified, all jobs	belonging to that user(s)  are
       removed.	 This form of invoking _a_t_r_m is useful only to the super-user.
