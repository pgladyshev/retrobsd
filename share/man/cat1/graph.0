       _G_r_a_p_h with no options takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as
       abscissas and ordinates of a graph.  Successive points are connected by
       straight	 lines.	  The graph is encoded on the standard output for dis-
       play by the _p_l_o_t(1G) filters.

       If the coordinates of a point are followed by a nonnumeric string, that
       string  is  printed  as	a label	beginning on the point.	 Labels	may be
       surrounded with quotes "...", in	which case they	may be empty  or  con-
       tain blanks and numbers;	labels never contain newlines.

       The following options are recognized, each as a separate	argument.

       --aa     Supply  abscissas	 automatically	(they  are  missing  from  the
	      input); spacing is given by the next argument  (default  1).   A
	      second  optional	argument  is  the starting point for automatic
	      abscissas	(default 0 or lower limit given	by --xx).

       --bb     Break (disconnect) the graph after each label in the input.

       --cc     Character	string given by	next argument  is  default  label  for
	      each point.

       --gg     Next  argument  is  grid style, 0	no grid, 1 frame with ticks, 2
	      full grid	(default).

       --ll     Next argument is label for graph.

       --mm     Next argument is mode (style) of	connecting  lines:  0  discon-
	      nected,  1  connected (default).	Some devices give distinguish-
	      able line	styles for other small integers.

       --ss     Save screen, don't erase before plotting.

       --xx [ ll ]
	      If ll is present, x axis is logarithmic.  Next 1 (or 2) arguments
	      are  lower (and upper) _x limits.	Third argument,	if present, is
	      grid spacing on _x	axis.  Normally	these  quantities  are	deter-
	      mined automatically.

       --yy [ ll ]
	      Similarly	for _y.

       --hh     Next argument is fraction	of space for height.

       --ww     Similarly	for width.

       --rr     Next  argument  is  fraction of space to move right before plot-
	      ting.

       --uu     Similarly	to move	up before plotting.

       --tt     Transpose	horizontal and vertical	axes.  (Option --xx now  applies
	      to the vertical axis.)

       A  legend  indicating  grid range is produced with a grid unless	the --ss
       option is present.

       If a specified lower  limit  exceeds  the  upper	 limit,	 the  axis  is
       reversed.

BBUUGGSS
       _G_r_a_p_h  stores  all  points  internally  and drops those for which there
       isn't room.
       Segments	that run out of	bounds are dropped, not	windowed.
       Logarithmic axes	may not	be reversed.
