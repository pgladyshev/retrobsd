       _T_c_o_p_y  is  designed  to	copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made
       about the tape is that there are	two tape marks at the end.  _T_c_o_p_y with
       only  a source tape specified will print	information about the sizes of
       records and tape	files.	If a destination is specified,	then,  a  copy
       will  be	made of	the source tape.  The blocking on the destination tape
       will be identical to that used on the source tape.  Copying a tape will
       yield the same output as	if just	printing the sizes.
