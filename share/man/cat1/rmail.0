       _R_m_a_i_l  interprets  incoming  mail  received  via	 _u_u_c_p(1C),  collapsing
       ``From''	lines in the form generated by _b_i_n_m_a_i_l(1) into a  single  line
       of  the	form ``return-path!sender'', and passing the processed mail on
       to _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8).

       _R_m_a_i_l is	explicitly designed for	use with _u_u_c_p and _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l.
