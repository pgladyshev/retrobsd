       For  each  directory  argument, _l_s lists	the contents of	the directory;
       for each	file argument, _l_s repeats its name and any  other  information
       requested.   By	default, the output is sorted alphabetically.  When no
       argument	is given, the current directory	is listed.  When several argu-
       ments are given,	the arguments are first	sorted appropriately, but file
       arguments are processed before directories and their contents.

       There are a large number	of options:

       --ll     List in long format, giving mode,	number of links,  owner,  size
	      in  bytes,  and  time  of	last modification for each file.  (See
	      below.)  If the file is a	 special  file	the  size  field  will
	      instead contain the major	and minor device numbers.  If the file
	      is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is printed
	      preceded by ``->''.

       --oo     Include the file flags in	a long (-l) output.

       --gg     Include the group	ownership of the file in a long	output.

       --tt     Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by name.

       --aa     List  all	 entries; in the absence of this option, entries whose
	      names begin with a period	(..)  are _n_o_t listed.

       --ss     Give size	in kilobytes of	each file.

       --dd     If argument is a directory, list only its	name; often used  with
	      --ll to get	the status of a	directory.

       --LL     If  argument  is a symbolic link,	list the file or directory the
	      link references rather than the link itself.

       --rr     Reverse the order	of sort	to get reverse	alphabetic  or	oldest
	      first as appropriate.

       --uu     Use time of last access instead of last modification for sorting
	      (with the	--tt option) and/or printing (with the --ll	option).

       --cc     Use time of file creation	for sorting or printing.

       --ii     For each file, print the i-number	in the	first  column  of  the
	      report.

       --ff     Output is	not sorted.

       --FF     cause directories	to be marked with a trailing `/', sockets with
	      a	trailing `=', symbolic links with a  trailing  `@',  and  exe-
	      cutable files with a trailing `*'.

       --RR     recursively list subdirectories encountered.

       --11     force one	entry per line output format; this is the default when
	      output is	not to a terminal.

       --CC     force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
	      a	terminal.

       --qq     force  printing  of  non-graphic characters in file names	as the
	      character	`?'; this is the default when output is	to a terminal.

       The mode	printed	under the --ll option contains 11	characters  which  are
       interpreted as follows: the first character is

       dd  if the entry is a directory;
       bb  if the entry is a block-type special file;
       cc  if the entry is a character-type special file;
       ll  if the entry is a symbolic link;
       ss  if the entry is a socket, or
       --  if the entry is a plain file.

       The next	9 characters are interpreted as	three sets of three bits each.
       The first set refers to owner permissions; the next refers  to  permis-
       sions  to  others  in  the same user-group; and the last	to all others.
       Within each set the three characters indicate  permission  respectively
       to  read,  to write, or to execute the file as a	program.  For a	direc-
       tory, `execute' permission is interpreted to mean permission to	search
       the directory.  The permissions are indicated as	follows:

       rr  if the file is readable;
       ww  if the file is writable;
       xx  if the file is executable;
       --  if the indicated permission is not granted.

       The  group-execute  permission  character is given as ss if the file has
       the set-group-id	bit set; likewise the user-execute permission  charac-
       ter is given as ss if the	file has the set-user-id bit set.

       The  last  character of the mode	(normally `x' or `-') is tt if the 1000
       bit of the mode is on.  See _c_h_m_o_d(1) for	the meaning of this mode.

       When the	sizes of the files in a	directory are listed, a	total count of
       blocks, including indirect blocks is printed.

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/passwd to get user id's for	`ls -l'.
       /etc/group to get group id's for	`ls -g'.

BBUUGGSS
       Newline and tab are considered printing characters in file names.

       The output device is assumed to be 80 columns wide.

       The  option  setting based on whether the output	is a teletype is unde-
       sirable as ``ls -s'' is much different than  ``ls -s | lpr''.   On  the
       other  hand,  not doing this setting would make old shell scripts which
       used _l_s almost certain losers.
