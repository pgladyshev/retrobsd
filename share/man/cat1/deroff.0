       _D_e_r_o_f_f reads each file in sequence and removes all _n_r_o_f_f	and _t_r_o_f_f com-
       mand lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions, _e_q_n  constructs
       (between	 `.EQ'	and  `.EN'  lines  or  between	delimiters), and table
       descriptions and	writes the remainder on	the standard  output.	_D_e_r_o_f_f
       follows	chains of included files (`.so'	and `.nx' commands); if	a file
       has already been	included, a `.so' is ignored and  a  `.nx'  terminates
       execution.   If	no input file is given,	_d_e_r_o_f_f reads from the standard
       input file.

       If the --ww flag is given,	the output is a	word list, one `word'  (string
       of  letters, digits, and	apostrophes, beginning with a letter; apostro-
       phes are	removed) per line, and all other characters  ignored.	Other-
       wise,  the  output  follows  the	original, with the deletions mentioned
       above.

BBUUGGSS
       _D_e_r_o_f_f is not a complete	_t_r_o_f_f interpreter, so it can  be  confused  by
       subtle constructs.  Most	errors result in too much rather than too lit-
       tle output.
