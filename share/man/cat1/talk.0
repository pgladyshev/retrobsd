       _T_a_l_k  is	 a  visual  communication program which	copies lines from your
       terminal	to that	of another user.

       If you wish to talk to someone on you own machine, then _p_e_r_s_o_n is  just
       the person's login name.	If you wish to talk to a user on another host,
       then _p_e_r_s_o_n is of the form :

			   _h_o_s_t_!_u_s_e_r  or
			   _h_o_s_t_._u_s_e_r  or
			   _h_o_s_t_:_u_s_e_r  or
			   _u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t

       though _h_o_s_t_@_u_s_e_r	is perhaps preferred.

       If you want to talk to a	user who is logged in more than	once, the _t_t_y_-
       _n_a_m_e argument may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name.

       When first called, it sends the message

	    Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine...
	    talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine.
	    talk: respond with:	talk your_name@your_machine

       to  the	user  you wish to talk to. At this point, the recipient	of the
       message should reply by typing

	    talk  your_name@your_machine

       It doesn't matter from which machine the	recipient replies, as long  as
       his login-name is the same.  Once communication is established, the two
       parties may type	simultaneously,	with their output appearing  in	 sepa-
       rate  windows.  Typing control L	will cause the screen to be reprinted,
       while your erase, kill, and word	kill characters	will work in  talk  as
       normal.	 To  exit, just	type your interrupt character; _t_a_l_k then moves
       the cursor to the bottom	of the screen and restores the terminal.

       Permission to talk may be denied	or granted by use of the _m_e_s_g command.
       At  the	outset	talking	 is  allowed.  Certain commands, in particular
       _n_r_o_f_f and _p_r(1) disallow	messages in order to prevent messy output.

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/hosts     to find the recipient's machine
       /var/run/utmp  to find the recipient's tty

       mesg(1),	who(1),	mail(1), write(1)

BBUUGGSS
       The version of _t_a_l_k(1) released with 4.3BSD uses	 a  protocol  that  is
       incompatible  with  the	protocol  used	in  the	 version released with
       4.2BSD.
