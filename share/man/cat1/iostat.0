       _I_o_s_t_a_t iteratively reports the number of	characters read	and written to
       terminals per second, and, for each disk, the number of	transfers  per
       second,	kilobytes  transferred	per  second,  and the milliseconds per
       average seek.  It also gives the	percentage  of	time  the  system  has
       spent  in  user	mode,  in  user	mode running low priority (niced) pro-
       cesses, in system mode, and idling.

       To compute this information, for	each disk,  seeks  and	data  transfer
       completions  and	number of words	transferred are	counted; for terminals
       collectively, the number	of input and output  characters	 are  counted.
       Also, each sixtieth of a	second,	the state of each disk is examined and
       a tally is made if the disk is active.  From these  numbers  and	 given
       the  transfer  rates of the devices it is possible to determine average
       seek times for each device.

       The optional _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l argument causes _i_o_s_t_a_t to report once each	_i_n_t_e_r_-
       _v_a_l seconds.  The first report is for  all time since a reboot and each
       subsequent report is for	the last interval only.

       The optional _c_o_u_n_t argument restricts the number	of reports.

       If more than 4 disk drives are configured in the	 system,  _i_o_s_t_a_t  dis-
       plays  only  the	 first	4  drives, with	priority given to Massbus disk
       drives (i.e. if both Unibus and Massbus	drives	are  present  and  the
       total  number  of  drives  exceeds 4, then some number of Unibus	drives
       will not	be displayed in	favor of the Massbus drives).  To force	_i_o_s_t_a_t
       to  display specific drives, their names	may be supplied	on the command
       line.
