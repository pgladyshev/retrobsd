       _C_a_l_e_n_d_a_r	 consults  the	file  `calendar'  in the current directory and
       prints out lines	that contain today's or	tomorrow's  date  anywhere  in
       the  line.  Most	reasonable month-day dates such	as `Dec. 7,' `december
       7,' `12/7,' etc., are recognized, but not `7 December' or  `7/12'.   If
       you  give the month as ``*'' with a date, i.e. ``* 1'', that day	in any
       month will do.  On weekends `tomorrow' extends through Monday.

       When an argument	is present, _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r does its job for every  user  who
       has a file `calendar' in	his login directory and	sends him any positive
       results by _m_a_i_l(1).  Normally this is done daily	in the wee hours under
       control of _c_r_o_n(8).

       The  file  `calendar'  is  first	 run  through  the ``C'' preprocessor,
       _/_l_i_b_/_c_p_p, to include any	other calendar files specified with the	 usual
       ``#include''  syntax.  Included calendars will usually be shared	by all
       users, maintained and documented	by the local administration.
