       _L_p_r_m  will  remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool queue.	 Since
       the spooling directory is protected from	users, using _l_p_r_m is  normally
       the only	method by which	a user may remove a job.

       _L_p_r_m  without  any arguments will delete	the currently active job if it
       is owned	by the user who	invoked	_l_p_r_m.

       If the --	flag is	specified, _l_p_r_m	will remove  all  jobs	which  a  user
       owns.   If  the	super-user  employs this flag, the spool queue will be
       emptied entirely. The owner is determined by the	user's login name  and
       host name on the	machine	where the _l_p_r command was invoked.

       Specifying  a  user's  name,  or	list of	user names, will cause _l_p_r_m to
       attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to that  user  (or  users).
       This form of invoking _l_p_r_m is useful only to the	super-user.

       A  user	may  dequeue  an  individual job by specifying its job number.
       This number may be obtained from	the _l_p_q(1) program, e.g.

	    % lpq -l

	    1st: ken			       [job #013ucbarpa]
		 (standard input)	       100 bytes
	    % lprm 13

       _L_p_r_m will announce the names of any files it removes and	is  silent  if
       there are no jobs in the	queue which match the request list.

       _L_p_r_m  will kill off an active daemon, if	necessary, before removing any
       spooling	files.	If a daemon is killed,	a  new	one  is	 automatically
       restarted upon completion of file removals.

       The  --PP	option	may be usd to specify the queue	associated with	a spe-
       cific printer (otherwise	the default  printer,  or  the	value  of  the
       PRINTER variable	in the environment is used).

       ``Permission  denied"  if the user tries	to remove files	other than his
       own.

       Since there are race conditions possible	in  the	 update	 of  the  lock
       file, the currently active job may be incorrectly identified.
