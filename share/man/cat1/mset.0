       _M_s_e_t  retrieves	mapping	information for	the ASCII keyboard to IBM 3270
       terminal	special	functions.  Normally,  these  mappings	are  found  in
       _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0	(see _m_a_p_3_2_7_0(5)).  This	information is used by
       the _t_n_3_2_7_0 command (see _t_n_3_2_7_0(1)).

       _M_s_e_t can	be used	store the mapping information in the process  environ-
       ment  in	 order	to  avoid  scanning  _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 each time
       _t_n_3_2_7_0 is invoked.  To do this, place the  following  command  in  your
       _._l_o_g_i_n file:

	  set noglob; setenv MAP3270 "`mset`"; unset noglob

       _M_s_e_t  first  determines	the  user's terminal type from the environment
       variable	   TTEERRMM.     Normally	 _m_s_e_t	 then	 uses	  the	  file
       _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 to find the keyboard mapping for	that terminal.
       However,	if the environment variable MMAAPP33227700 exists  and	 contains  the
       entry for the specified terminal, then that definition is used.	If the
       value of	MMAAPP33227700	begins with a slash (`/') then it is assumed to	be the
       full  pathname  of  an alternate	mapping	file and that file is searched
       first.  In any case, if the mapping for the terminal is	not  found  in
       the  environment, nor in	an alternate map file, nor in the standard map
       file, then the same search is performed for an  entry  for  a  terminal
       type  of	uunnkknnoowwnn..  If that search also fails, then a default mapping is
       used.

BBUUGGSS
       If the entry for	the specific terminal exceeds 1024 bytes, _c_s_h(1)  will
       fail to set the environment variable.  _M_s_e_t should probably detect this
       case and	output the path	to the _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 file instead  of	 the  terminal
       entry.
