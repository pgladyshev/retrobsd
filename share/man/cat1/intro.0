       This  section  describes	 publicly  accessible  commands	 in alphabetic
       order.  Certain distinctions of purpose are made	in the headings:

       (1)    Commands of general utility.

       (1C)   Commands for communication with other systems.

       (1G)   Commands used primarily for graphics and computer-aided design.

       N.B.: Commands related to system	maintenance used to appear in  section
       1  manual  pages	and were distinguished by (1M) at the top of the page.
       These manual pages now appear in	section	8.

       Upon termination	each command returns two bytes of status, one supplied
       by  the	system	giving	the cause for termination, and (in the case of
       `normal'	termination)  one  supplied  by	 the  program,	see  _w_a_i_t  and
       _e_x_i_t(2).	  The  former  byte is 0 for normal termination, the latter is
       customarily 0 for successful execution, nonzero	to  indicate  troubles
       such  as	 erroneous  parameters,	 bad  or  inaccessible	data, or other
       inability to cope with the task at hand.	 It is called variously	 `exit
       code', `exit status' or `return code', and is described only where spe-
       cial conventions	are involved.
