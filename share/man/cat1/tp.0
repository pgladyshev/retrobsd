       _T_p  saves  and  restores	 files on DECtape or magtape.  Its actions are
       controlled by the _k_e_y argument.	The key	is a string of characters con-
       taining	at  most one function letter and possibly one or more function
       modifiers.  Other arguments to the command are file or directory	 names
       specifying  which  files	are to be dumped, restored, or listed.	In all
       cases, appearance of a directory	name refers to the files  and  (recur-
       sively) subdirectories of that directory.

       The  function  portion  of the key is specified by one of the following
       letters:

       rr       The named files are written on the tape.	  If  files  with  the
	       same  names already exist, they are replaced.  `Same' is	deter-
	       mined by	string comparison, so `./abc' can never	be the same as
	       `/usr/dmr/abc' even if `/usr/dmr' is the	current	directory.  If
	       no file argument	is given, `..' is the default.

       uu       updates the tape.  uu is like rr,, but a file is replaced only  if
	       its  modification  date	is  later  than	the date stored	on the
	       tape; that is to	say, if	it has changed since it	was dumped.  uu
	       is the default command if none is given.

       dd       deletes the named files from the	tape.  At least	one name argu-
	       ment must be given.  This function is  not  permitted  on  mag-
	       tapes.

       xx       extracts	the named files	from the tape to the file system.  The
	       owner and mode are restored.  If	no file	argument is given, the
	       entire contents of the tape are extracted.

       tt       lists the names of the specified	files.	If no file argument is
	       given, the entire contents of the tape is listed.

       The following characters	may be used in addition	to  the	 letter	 which
       selects the function desired.

       mm	 Specifies magtape as opposed to DECtape.

       00,,......,,77	 This modifier selects the drive on which the tape is mounted.
		 For DECtape, xx	is default; for	magtape	`0' is the default.

       vv	 Normally _t_p does its work silently.  The vv  (verbose)	option
		 causes	it to type the name of each file it treats preceded by
		 the function letter.  With  the  tt  function,	vv  gives  more
		 information about the tape entries than just the name.

       cc	 means	a  fresh  dump is being	created; the tape directory is
		 cleared before	beginning.  Usable only	with rr	and  uu..	  This
		 option	 is  assumed  with  magtape  since it is impossible to
		 selectively overwrite magtape.

       ii	 Errors	reading	and writing the	tape are noted,	but no	action
		 is  taken.   Normally,	 errors	 cause a return	to the command
		 level.

       ff	 Use the first named file, rather than a tape, as the archive.
		 This  option  currently  acts	like mm;	_i_._e_.  rr	implies	cc, and
		 neither dd nor uu are permitted.

       ww	 causes	_t_p to  pause  before  treating	each  file,  type  the
		 indicative letter and the file	name (as with vv) and await the
		 user's	response.  Response yy means  `yes',  so	 the  file  is
		 treated.   Null  response  means  `no', and the file does not
		 take part in  whatever	 is  being  done.   Response  xx	 means
		 `exit';  the  _t_p  command  terminates	immediately.  In the xx
		 function, files previously asked about	 have  been  extracted
		 already.   With  rr,,  uu,,  and dd	no change has been made	to the
		 tape.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Several;	the non-obvious	one is `Phase error',  which  means  the  file
       changed after it	was selected for dumping but before it was dumped.

BBUUGGSS
       A single	file with several links	to it is treated like several files.

       Binary-coded  control  information  makes  magnetic tapes written by _t_p
       difficult to carry to other machines; _t_a_r(1) avoids the problem.
