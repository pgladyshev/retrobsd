       _F_p_r  is a filter	that transforms	files formatted	according to Fortran's
       carriage	control	conventions into files	formatted  according  to  UNIX
       line printer conventions.

       _F_p_r  copies  its	 input onto its	output,	replacing the carriage control
       characters with characters that will produce the	intended effects  when
       printed	using _l_p_r(1).  The first character of each line	determines the
       vertical	spacing	as follows:

	   +---------------+--------------------------------+
	   |   Character   | Vertical Space Before Printing |
	   |---------------+--------------------------------|
	   |	 Blank	   | One line			    |
	   |	   0	   | Two lines			    |
	   |	   1	   | To	first line of next page	    |
	   |	   +	   | No	advance			    |
	   +---------------+--------------------------------+


       A blank line is treated as if its first character is a blank.  A	 blank
       that  appears  as  a  carriage  control character is deleted. A zero is
       changed to a newline.  A	one is changed to a form feed. The effects  of
       a "+" are simulated using backspaces.
