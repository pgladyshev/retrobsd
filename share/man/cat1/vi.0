       _V_i  (visual)  is	a display oriented text	editor based on	_e_x(1).	_E_x and
       _v_i run the same code; it	is possible to get to the command mode	of  _e_x
       from within _v_i and vice-versa.

       The  _V_i	_Q_u_i_c_k  _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  card and the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _E_d_i_t_i_n_g
       _w_i_t_h _V_i provide full details on using _v_i_.

BBUUGGSS
       Software	tabs using ^^TT work only	immediately after the _a_u_t_o_i_n_d_e_n_t_.

       Left and	right shifts on	intelligent terminals don't make use of	insert
       and delete character operations in the terminal.

       The _w_r_a_p_m_a_r_g_i_n option can be fooled since it looks  at  output  columns
       when  blanks  are  typed.  If a long word passes	through	the margin and
       onto the	next line without a break, then	the line won't be broken.

       Insert/delete within a line can be slow if tabs are present on intelli-
       gent terminals, since the terminals need	help in	doing this correctly.

       Saving text on deletes in the named buffers is somewhat inefficient.

       The  _s_o_u_r_c_e command does	not work when executed as ::ssoouurrccee; there is no
       way to use the ::aappppeenndd, ::cchhaannggee,	and ::iinnsseerrtt commands, since it is  not
       possible	 to  give  more	 than one line of input	to a :: escape.	To use
       these on	a ::gglloobbaall you must QQ to	_e_x command  mode,  execute  them,  and
       then reenter the	screen editor with _v_i or _o_p_e_n_.
