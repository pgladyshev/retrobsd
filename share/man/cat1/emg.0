     eemmgg -- very small Emacs-like text editor

     eemmgg, or Ersatz Mg,	is an Emacs-like text editor designed for RetroBSD and
     other memory-constrained environments.  eemmgg was originally	created	to fit
     into an operating environment of 96K of RAM, and one in which Mg did not
     fit and Ersatz Emacs did not build.  By combining parts of	each a working
     editor was	created.

     When invoked without a file argument, eemmgg creates a _*_s_c_r_a_t_c_h_* buffer.
     This buffer can be	edited and saved like a	named buffer.

     As	both Ersatz Emacs and Mg are Public Domain, eemmgg	is also	Public Domain.

FFIILLEESS
     There is a	chart of key bindings in _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_o_c_/_e_m_g_/_e_m_g_._k_e_y_s.
     Consulting	this file is a must.  While eemmgg	strives	to maintain compati-
     bility with larger	Emacs implementations, there may be features inten-
     tionally left unimplemented in order to keep eemmgg as small as possible.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     eemmgg is a combination of Ersatz Emacs and Mg and therefore all authors for
     both deserve credit.  Ersatz Emacs	and Mg were combined by	Brian Callahan
     <_b_c_a_l_l_a_h_@_o_p_e_n_b_s_d_._o_r_g> to create eemmgg.

BBUUGGSS
     It	would be nice to have automatic	window resizing.  It would also	be
     nice if eemmgg could clear the screen	when quit, like	Mg does.
