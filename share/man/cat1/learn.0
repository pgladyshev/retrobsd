       _L_e_a_r_n  gives Computer Aided Instruction courses and practice in the use
       of UNIX,	the C Shell, and the Berkeley text editors.   To  get  started
       simply  type  lleeaarrnn.   If  you had used _l_e_a_r_n before and	left your last
       session without completing a subject, the program will use  information
       in $HOME/.learnrc to start you up in the	same place you left off.  Your
       first time through, _l_e_a_r_n will ask questions to find out	what you  want
       to  do.	 Some  questions may be	bypassed by naming a _s_u_b_j_e_c_t, and more
       yet by naming a _l_e_s_s_o_n.	You may	enter the  _l_e_s_s_o_n  as  a  number  that
       _l_e_a_r_n  gave  you	 in a previous session.	 If you	do not know the	lesson
       number, you may enter the _l_e_s_s_o_n	as a word, and _l_e_a_r_n will look for the
       first  lesson  containing  it.  If the _l_e_s_s_o_n is	`--', _l_e_a_r_n prompts for
       each lesson; this is useful for debugging.

       The _s_u_b_j_e_c_t's presently handled are

	    files
	    editor
	    vi
	    morefiles
	    macros
	    eqn
	    C

       There are a few special commands.  The command `bye' terminates a _l_e_a_r_n
       session	and `where' tells you of your progress,	with `where m' telling
       you more.  The command `again' re-displays the text of the  lesson  and
       `again _l_e_s_s_o_n'  lets  you  review _l_e_s_s_o_n.  There	is no way for _l_e_a_r_n to
       tell you	the answers it expects in English, however, the	command	`hint'
       prints  the last	part of	the lesson script used to evaluate a response,
       while `hint m' prints the whole lesson  script.	 This  is  useful  for
       debugging  lessons  and	might  possibly	give you an idea about what it
       expects.

       The --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y option allows one	to exercise a script in	a  nonstandard
       place.

BBUUGGSS
       The main	strength of _l_e_a_r_n_, that	it asks	the student to	use  the  real
       UNIX, also makes	possible baffling mistakes.  It	is helpful, especially
       for nonprogrammers, to have a UNIX initiate near	 at  hand  during  the
       first sessions.

       Occasionally lessons are	incorrect, sometimes because the local version
       of a command operates in	a non-standard	way.   Occasionally  a	lesson
       script does not recognize all the different correct responses, in which
       case the	`hint' command may be useful.  Such  lessons  may  be  skipped
       with  the `skip'	command, but it	takes some sophistication to recognize
       the situation.

       To find a _l_e_s_s_o_n	given as a word, _l_e_a_r_n does a simple _f_g_r_e_p(1)  through
       the  lessons.   It  is unclear whether this sort	of subject indexing is
       better than none.

       Spawning	a new shell is required	for each of  many  user	 and  internal
       functions.

       The  `vi' lessons are provided separately from the others.  To use them
       see your	system administrator.
