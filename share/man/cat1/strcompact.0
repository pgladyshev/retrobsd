       strcompact - string compaction for object files

       strcompact scans	the symbol and string tables of	an object file looking
       for multiple references in the symbol table to the  same	 string.   The
       string  offset  of symbol table entries is updated to preserve only one
       copy of the string.

       ssttrrccoommppaacctt cut the size of the kernel string table by about 25%.

       The user	must have write	permission to the object/executable file.

       ssttrrccoommppaacctt writes to _s_t_d_e_r_r the number of shared	strings	found.

       strcompact exits	0 if successful, and >0	if an error occurred.

BBUUGGSS
       Execution speed leaves much to be desired - on a	11/73 it takes about 4
       minutes to process the string table of the kernel.  Fortunately this is
       only done once when the kernel is created.

       Although	ssttrrccoommppaacctt may be run on .o files as well as  executables  but
       this is probably	not worth the trouble since the	linker will not	create
       shared strings in the final executable.
