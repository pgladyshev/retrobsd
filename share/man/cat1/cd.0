       _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  becomes  the	new  working directory.	 The process must have
       execute (search)	permission in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

       Because a new process is	created	to execute each	command, _c_d  would  be
       ineffective  if	it  were written as a normal command.  It is therefore
       recognized and executed by the shells.  In _c_s_h(1)  you  may  specify  a
       list  of	 directories in	which _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y	is to be sought	as a subdirec-
       tory if it is not a subdirectory	of  the	 current  directory;  see  the
       description of the _c_d_p_a_t_h variable in _c_s_h(1).
