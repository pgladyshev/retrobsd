       _R_o_f_f_b_i_b prints out all records in a bibliographic database, in bibliog-
       raphy  format  rather  than  as footnotes or endnotes.  Generally it is
       used in conjunction with	_s_o_r_t_b_i_b:

       _R_o_f_f_b_i_b accepts most of the options understood by _n_r_o_f_f(1), most	impor-
       tantly the --TT flag to specify terminal type.

       If  abstracts or	comments are entered following the %X field key, _r_o_f_f_-
       _b_i_b will	format them into paragraphs  for  an  annotated	 bibliography.
       Several	%X  fields  may	 be given if several annotation	paragraphs are
       desired.	 The --xx	flag will suppress the printing	of these abstracts.

       A user-defined set of macros may	be  specified  after  the  --mm  option.
       There  should  be  a space between the --mm and the macro filename.  This
       set    of    macros    will    replace	 the	ones	defined	    in
       /usr/share/tmac/tmac.bib.   The	--VV  flag  will send output to the Ver-
       satec; the --QQ flag will queue output for	the phototypesetter.

       Four command-line registers control formatting style of the  bibliogra-
       phy,  much  like	the number registers of	_m_s(7).	The command-line argu-
       ment --rrN1 will number the references starting at	 one  (1).   The  flag
       --rrV2  will  double space	the bibliography, while	--rrV1 will double space
       references but single space annotation paragraphs.  The line length can
       be changed from the default 6.5 inches to 6 inches with the --rrL6i argu-
       ment, and the page offset can be	set from the default of	0 to one  inch
       by  specifying  --rrO1i  (capital O, not zero).  Note: with the --VV	and --QQ
       flags the default page offset is	already	one inch.
