       _Y_a_c_c  converts a	context-free grammar into a set	of tables for a	simple
       automaton which executes	an LR(1) parsing algorithm.  The  grammar  may
       be ambiguous; specified precedence rules	are used to break ambiguities.

       The output file,	_y_._t_a_b_._c, must be compiled by the C compiler to produce
       a program _y_y_p_a_r_s_e.  This	program	must be	loaded with the	 lexical  ana-
       lyzer  program,	_y_y_l_e_x,	as well	as _m_a_i_n	and _y_y_e_r_r_o_r, an	error handling
       routine.	 These routines	must be	supplied by the	user; _L_e_x(1) is	useful
       for creating lexical analyzers usable by	_y_a_c_c.

       If  the --vv flag is given, the file _y_._o_u_t_p_u_t is prepared,	which contains
       a description of	the parsing tables and a report	on conflicts generated
       by ambiguities in the grammar.

       If  the	-dd flag	is used, the file _y_._t_a_b_._h is generated with the	_d_e_f_i_n_e
       statements that associate the  _y_a_c_c-assigned  `token  codes'  with  the
       user-declared  `token  names'.	This  allows  source  files other than
       _y_._t_a_b_._c to access the token codes.

       The  number  of reduce-reduce and shift-reduce conflicts	is reported on
       the standard output; a more detailed report is found  in	 the  _y_._o_u_t_p_u_t
       file.   Similarly,  if some rules are not reachable from	the start sym-
       bol, this is also reported.

BBUUGGSS
       Because file names are fixed, at	most one _y_a_c_c process can be active in
       a given directory at a time.
