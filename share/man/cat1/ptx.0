       _P_t_x  generates  a permuted index	to file	_i_n_p_u_t on file _o_u_t_p_u_t (standard
       input and output	default).  It has three	phases:	 the  first  does  the
       permutation,  generating	 one  line  for	each keyword in	an input line.
       The keyword is rotated to the front.  The permuted file is then sorted.
       Finally,	 the sorted lines are rotated so the keyword comes at the mid-
       dle of the page.	 _P_t_x produces output in	the form:

	      .xx "tail" "before keyword" "keyword and after" "head"

       where .xx may be	an _n_r_o_f_f or _t_r_o_f_f(1) macro  for	 user-defined  format-
       ting.   The  _b_e_f_o_r_e _k_e_y_w_o_r_d and _k_e_y_w_o_r_d _a_n_d _a_f_t_e_r fields	incorporate as
       much of the line	as will	fit around the keyword when it is  printed  at
       the  middle  of	the  page.  _T_a_i_l and _h_e_a_d_, at least one	of which is an
       empty string "",	are wrapped-around pieces small	enough to fit  in  the
       unused  space at	the opposite end of the	line.  When original text must
       be discarded, `/' marks the spot.

       The following options can be applied:

       --ff     Fold upper and lower case	letters	for sorting.

       --tt     Prepare the output for the  phototypesetter;  the	 default  line
	      length is	100 characters.

       --ww _n   Use  the next argument, _n_, as the	width of the output line.  The
	      default line length is 72	characters.

       --gg _n   Use the next argument, _n_,	as the number of characters  to	 allow
	      for  each	 gap  among  the  four	parts  of  the line as finally
	      printed.	The default gap	is 3 characters.

       --oo only
	      Use as keywords only the words given in the _o_n_l_y file.

       --ii ignore
	      Do not use as keywords any words given in	the _i_g_n_o_r_e  file.   If
	      the  --ii  and --oo options are missing, use _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_e_i_g_n as
	      the _i_g_n_o_r_e file.

       --bb break
	      Use the characters in the	_b_r_e_a_k file to separate words.  In  any
	      case,  tab,  newline,  and  space	 characters are	always used as
	      break characters.

       --rr     Take any leading nonblank	characters of each input line to be  a
	      reference	identifier (as to a page or chapter) separate from the
	      text of the line.	 Attach	that identifier	as a 5th field on each
	      output line.

       The index for this manual was generated using _p_t_x_.
