       _C_a_t reads each _f_i_l_e in sequence and displays it on the standard output.
       Thus

       cat file

       displays	the file on the	standard output, and

       cat file1 file2 >file3

       concatenates the	first two files	and places the result on the third.

       If no input file	is given, or if	the argument `-' is  encountered,  _c_a_t
       reads  from  the	 standard input	file.  Output is buffered in the block
       size recommended	by _s_t_a_t(2) unless the standard output is  a  terminal,
       when  it	 is  line buffered.  The --uu option makes the output completely
       unbuffered.

       The --nn option displays the output lines preceded	by lines numbers, num-
       bered sequentially from 1.  Specifying the --bb option with the --nn	option
       omits the line numbers from blank lines.

       The --ss option crushes out multiple adjacent empty  lines	 so  that  the
       output is displayed single spaced.

       The  --vv	option displays	non-printing characters	so that	they are visi-
       ble.  Control characters	print like ^X for control-x; the delete	 char-
       acter  (octal  0177) prints as ^?.  Non-ascii characters	(with the high
       bit set)	are printed as M- (for meta) followed by the character of  the
       low  7  bits.   A --ee option may be given	with the --vv option, which dis-
       plays a `$' character at	the end	 of  each  line.   Specifying  the  --tt
       option with the --vv option displays tab characters as ^I.

BBUUGGSS
       Beware  of `cat a b >a' and `cat	a b >b', which destroy the input files
       before reading them.
