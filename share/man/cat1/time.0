       The  given  command  is executed; after it is complete, _t_i_m_e prints the
       elapsed time during the command,	the time spent in the system, and  the
       time spent in execution of the command.	Times are reported in seconds.

       On  a  PDP-11, the execution time can depend on what kind of memory the
       program happens to land in; the user time in MOS	is often half what  it
       is in core.

       The times are printed on	the diagnostic output stream.

       _T_i_m_e is built in	to _c_s_h(1), using a different output format.

BBUUGGSS
       Elapsed	time  is  accurate to the second, while	the CPU	times are mea-
       sured to	the 100th second.  Thus	the sum	of the CPU times can be	up  to
       a second	larger than the	elapsed	time.

       _T_i_m_e  is	 a  built-in  command to _c_s_h(1), with a	much different syntax.
       This command is available as ``/bin/time'' to _c_s_h users.
