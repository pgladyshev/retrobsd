       _W_h_i_c_h takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be exe-
       cuted had these	names  been  given  as	commands.   Each  argument  is
       expanded	 if  it	 is  aliased,  and searched for	along the user's path.
       Both aliases and	path are taken from the	user's .cshrc file.

FFIILLEESS
       ~/.cshrc	 source	of aliases and path values

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       A diagnostic is given for names which are aliased to more than a	single
       word,  or if an executable file with the	argument name was not found in
       the path.

BBUUGGSS
       Must be executed	by a csh, since	only csh's know	about aliases.
