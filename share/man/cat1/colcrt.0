       _C_o_l_c_r_t  provides	 virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences for
       terminals  without  such	 capability,  and  on  which  overstriking  is
       destructive.   Half-line	characters and underlining (changed to dashing
       `-') are	placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

       The optional -- suppresses all underlining.  It is especially useful for
       previewing _a_l_l_b_o_x_e_d tables from _t_b_l(1).

       The  option  --22 causes all half-lines to	be printed, effectively	double
       spacing the output.  Normally, a	minimal	space output  format  is  used
       which will suppress empty lines.	 The program never suppresses two con-
       secutive	empty lines, however.  The --22 option  is  useful  for  sending
       output  to  the	line printer when the output contains superscripts and
       subscripts which	would otherwise	be invisible.

       A typical use of	_c_o_l_c_r_t would be

       Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the	`--' option so  that  a
       true  underline	character  would show; if we did this, however,	_c_o_l_c_r_t
       wouldn't	get rid	of _c_u_'_d	underlining completely.

       Can't back up more than 102 lines.

       General overstriking is lost; as	a special case `|' overstruck with `-'
       or underline becomes `+'.

       Lines are trimmed to 132	characters.

       Some  provision	should	be  made  for processing superscripts and sub-
       scripts in documents which are already double-spaced.
