       _E_x is the root of a family of editors: _e_d_i_t_, _e_x and _v_i_.	_E_x is a	super-
       set of _e_d_, with the most	notable	 extension  being  a  display  editing
       facility.  Display based	editing	is the focus of	_v_i_.

       If  you	have not used _e_d_, or are a casual user,	you will find that the
       editor _e_d_i_t is convenient for you.  It avoids some of the  complexities
       of _e_x used mostly by systems programmers	and persons very familiar with
       _e_d_.

       If you have a CRT terminal, you may wish	to use a display based editor;
       in this case see	_v_i(1), which is	a command which	focuses	on the display
       editing portion of _e_x_.

       The document _E_d_i_t_: _A _t_u_t_o_r_i_a_l (USD:14) provides a comprehensive	intro-
       duction to _e_d_i_t assuming	no previous knowledge of computers or the UNIX
       system.

       The _E_x _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e	_M_a_n_u_a_l _- _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _3_._7 (USD:16) is a  comprehensive  and
       complete	 manual	 for  the  command mode	features of _e_x_,	but you	cannot
       learn to	use the	editor by reading it.  For  an	introduction  to  more
       advanced	 forms of editing using	the command mode of _e_x see the editing
       documents written by Brian Kernighan for	the editor _e_d_; the material in
       the introductory	and advanced documents works also with _e_x_.

       play editor _v_i and provides reference material on _v_i_.  In addition, the
       _V_i  _Q_u_i_c_k  _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  card  summarizes  the commands of _v_i in a useful,
       functional way, and is useful with the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n_.

AAUUTTHHOORR
       Originally written by William Joy
       Mark Horton has maintained the editor since version 2.7,	adding macros,
       support	for  many  unusual  terminals, and other features such as word
       abbreviation mode.

BBUUGGSS
       The _u_n_d_o	command	causes all marks to be lost on lines changed and  then
       restored	if the marked lines were changed.

       _U_n_d_o never clears the buffer modified condition.

       The  _z  command	prints a number	of logical rather than physical	lines.
       More than a screen full of output may result if long lines are present.

       File input/output errors	don't print a name if  the  command  line  ``--''
       option is used.

       There is	no easy	way to do a single scan	ignoring case.

       The  editor  does  not  warn if text is placed in named buffers and not
       used before exiting the editor.

       Null characters are discarded in	input  files,  and  cannot  appear  in
       resultant files.
