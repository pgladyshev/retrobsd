       _F_r_o_m  prints out	the mail header	lines in your mailbox file to show you
       who your	mail is	from.  If _u_s_e_r is specified, then  _u_s_e_r's  mailbox  is
       examined	 instead  of  your  own.  If the -s option is given, then only
       headers for mail	sent by	_s_e_n_d_e_r are printed.
