       _B_i_f_f  informs  the  system  whether  you	 want to be notified when mail
       arrives during the current terminal session.  The command

	      bbiiffff yy

       enables notification; the command

	      bbiiffff nn

       disables	it.  When mail notification is enabled,	the header  and	 first
       few  lines  of the message will be printed on your screen whenever mail
       arrives.	 A ``biff y'' command is often included	in the file _._l_o_g_i_n  or
       _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e	to be executed at each login.

       _B_i_f_f  operates  asynchronously.	 For  synchronous notification use the
       MAIL variable of	_s_h(1) or the _m_a_i_l variable of _c_s_h(1).
