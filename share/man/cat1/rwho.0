       The  _r_w_h_o  command produces output similar to _w_h_o_, but for all machines
       on the local network.  If no report has been received  from  a  machine
       for  5  minutes	then  _r_w_h_o  assumes  the machine is down, and does not
       report users last known to be logged into that machine.

       If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more,  then  _r_w_h_o
       reports	this  idle  time.  If a	user hasn't typed to the system	for an
       hour or more, then the user will	be omitted from	 the  output  of  _r_w_h_o
       unless the --aa flag is given.

       This is unwieldy	when the number	of machines on the local net is	large.
