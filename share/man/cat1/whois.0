       whois help
	      Produces a helpful message similar to the	following:

       Please  enter a name or a handle	(``ident"), such as ``Smith" or	``SRI-
       NIC".  Starting with a period forces a name-only	search;	starting  with
       exclamation point forces	handle-only.  Examples:
	    Smith		[looks for name	or handle SMITH	   ]
	    !SRI-NIC		[looks for handle SRI-NIC only	   ]
	    .Smith, John	[looks for name	JOHN SMITH only	   ]
       Adding ``..." to	the argument will match	anything from that point, e.g.
       ``ZU..."	will match ZUL,	ZUM, etc.

       To have the ENTIRE membership list of a group or	organization,  if  you
       are asking about	a group	or org,	shown with the record, use an asterisk
       character `*' directly preceding	 the  given  argument.	 [CAUTION:  If
       there  are  a  lot  of members this will	take a long time!]  You	may of
       course use exclamation point and	asterisk, or  a	 period	 and  asterisk
       together.
