       _D_i_f_f_3  compares	three  versions	 of  a file, and publishes disagreeing
       ranges of text flagged with these codes:

       ====	       all three files differ

       ====1	       _f_i_l_e_1 is	different

       ====2	       _f_i_l_e_2 is	different

       ====3	       _f_i_l_e_3 is	different

       The type	of change suffered in converting a given range of a given file
       to some other is	indicated in one of these ways:

       _f :: _n_1 aa	       Text  is	to be appended after line number _n_1 in file _f_,
		       where _f = 1, 2, or 3.

       _f :: _n_1 ,,	_n_2 cc   Text is to be changed in	the range line _n_1 to line  _n_2.
		       If _n_1 = _n_2_, the range may be abbreviated	to _n_1.

       The  original contents of the range follows immediately after a cc indi-
       cation.	When the contents of two files are identical, the contents  of
       the lower-numbered file is suppressed.

       Under  the  --ee  option, _d_i_f_f_3 publishes a script	for the	editor _e_d that
       will incorporate	into _f_i_l_e_1 all changes between _f_i_l_e_2 and  _f_i_l_e_3_,  _i_._e.
       the  changes  that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3.  Option --xx
       (--33) produces  a	 script	 to  incorporate  only	changes	 flagged  ====
       (====3).	  The  following  command  will	 apply the resulting script to
       `file1'.

		(cat script; echo '1,$p') | ed - file1

       The --EE and --XX are similar to --ee and --xx, respectively, but  treat	 over-
       lapping	changes	 (i.e.,	changes	that would be flagged with ====	in the
       normal listing) differently.  The overlapping  lines  from  both	 files
       will be inserted	by the edit script, bracketed by "<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>"
       lines.

       For example, suppose lines 7-8 are changed in  both  file1  and	file2.
       Applying	the edit script	generated by the command
			    "diff3 -E file1 file2 file3"
       to file1	results	in the file:

	      lines 1-6
	      of file1
	      <<<<<<< file1
	      lines 7-8
	      of file1
	      =======
	      lines 7-8
	      of file3
	      >>>>>>> file3
	      rest of file1

       The  --EE	option	is  used  by  RCS  _m_e_r_g_e(1) to insure that overlapping
       changes in the merged files are	preserved  and	brought	 to  someone's
       attention.
