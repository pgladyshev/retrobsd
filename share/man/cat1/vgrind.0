       _V_g_r_i_n_d formats the program sources which	are arguments in a nice	 style
       using  _t_r_o_f_f(1)	Comments are placed in italics,	keywords in bold face,
       and the name of the current function is listed down the margin of  each
       page as it is encountered.

       _V_g_r_i_n_d runs in two basic	modes, filter mode or regular mode.  In	filter
       mode _v_g_r_i_n_d acts	as a filter in a manner	similar	to _t_b_l(1).  The	 stan-
       dard  input  is passed directly to the standard output except for lines
       bracketed by the	_t_r_o_f_f_-_l_i_k_e macros:

       .vS    -	starts processing

       .vE    -	ends processing

       These lines are formatted as described above.   The  output  from  this
       filter  can be passed to	_t_r_o_f_f for output.  There need be no particular
       ordering	with _e_q_n(1) or _t_b_l(1).

       In regular mode _v_g_r_i_n_d accepts input files, processes them, and	passes
       them to _t_r_o_f_f(1)	for output.

       In  both	 modes	_v_g_r_i_n_d passes any lines	beginning with a decimal point
       without conversion.

       The options are:

       --ff     forces filter mode

       --      forces input to be taken from standard input (default if	--ff  is
	      specified	)

       --tt     similar to the same option in _t_r_o_f_f causing formatted text to go
	      to the standard output

       --nn     forces no	keyword	bolding

       --xx     outputs the index	file in	a ``pretty'' format.  The  index  file
	      itself  is  produced  whenever  _v_g_r_i_n_d is	run with a file	called
	      _i_n_d_e_x in the current directory.  The index of  function  defini-
	      tions can	then be	run off	by giving _v_g_r_i_n_d the --xx	option and the
	      file _i_n_d_e_x as argument.

       --WW     forces output to the (wide) Versatec  printer  rather  than  the
	      (narrow) Varian

       --ss     specifies	a point	size to	use on output (exactly the same	as the
	      argument of a .ps)

       --hh     specifies	a particular  header  to  put  on  every  output  page
	      (default is the file name)

       --dd     specifies	 an  alternate	language  definitions file (default is
	      /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs)

       --ll     specifies	the language  to  use.	 Currently  known  are	PASCAL
	      (--llpp),  MODEL  (--llmm),CC  (--llcc or the default), CSH	(--llccsshh), SHELL
	      (--llsshh), RATFOR  (--llrr),  MODULA2  (--llmmoodd22),  YACC	(--llyyaacccc),  ISP
	      (--lliisspp), and ICON	(--llII).

BBUUGGSS
       Vfontedpr assumes that a	certain	programming style is followed:

       For  CC -	function names can be preceded on a line only by spaces, tabs,
       or an asterisk.	The parenthesized arguments must also be on  the  same
       line.

       For PPAASSCCAALL - function names need	to appear on the same line as the key-
       words _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n or _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_.

       For MMOODDEELL - function names need to appear on the	same line as the  key-
       words _i_s	_b_e_g_i_n_p_r_o_c_.

       If  these conventions are not followed, the indexing and	marginal func-
       tion name comment mechanisms will fail.

       More generally, arbitrary formatting styles for	programs  mostly  look
       bad.   The  use	of spaces to align source code fails miserably;	if you
       plan to _v_g_r_i_n_d your program you should  use  tabs.   This  is  somewhat
       inevitable since	the font used by _v_g_r_i_n_d	is variable width.

       The mechanism of	ctags in recognizing functions should be used here.

       Filter  mode  does  not	work in	documents using	the -me	or -ms macros.
       (So what	use is it anyway?)
