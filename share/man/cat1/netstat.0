       The  _n_e_t_s_t_a_t command symbolically displays the contents of various net-
       work-related data structures.  There are	a number  of  output  formats,
       depending on the	options	for the	information presented.	The first form
       of the command displays a list of active	 sockets  for  each  protocol.
       The  second form	presents the contents of one of	the other network data
       structures according to the option selected.   Using  the  third	 form,
       with  an	 _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l  specified,  _n_e_t_s_t_a_t	will  continuously display the
       information regarding packet traffic on the configured  network	inter-
       faces.

       The options have	the following meaning:

       --AA     With  the	default	display, show the address of any protocol con-
	      trol blocks associated with sockets; used	for debugging.

       --aa     With the default display,	show the state of  all	sockets;  nor-
	      mally sockets used by server processes are not shown.

       --hh     Show the state of	the IMP	host table.

       --ii     Show  the	 state	of  interfaces which have been auto-configured
	      (interfaces statically configured	into a system, but not located
	      at boot time are not shown).

       --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
	      Show  information	only about this	interface; used	with an	_i_n_t_e_r_-
	      _v_a_l as described below.

       --mm     Show statistics recorded by the memory management	routines  (the
	      network manages a	private	pool of	memory buffers).

       --nn     Show  network  addresses as numbers (normally _n_e_t_s_t_a_t interprets
	      addresses	and attempts  to  display  them	 symbolically).	  This
	      option may be used with any of the display formats.

       --ss     Show per-protocol	statistics.

       --rr     Show  the	routing	tables.	 When --ss is also present, show routing
	      statistics instead.

       --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y
	      Limit statistics or address control block	reports	 to  those  of
	      the  specified  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y.	The following address families
	      are recognized: _i_n_e_t, for	AAFF__IINNEETT, _n_s, for AAFF__NNSS,	and _u_n_i_x,  for
	      AAFF__UUNNIIXX.

       The  arguments,	_s_y_s_t_e_m	and  _c_o_r_e  allow  substitutes for the defaults
       ``/vmunix'' and ``/dev/kmem''.

       The default display, for	active sockets,	shows  the  local  and	remote
       addresses,  send	 and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
       internal	state of the  protocol.	  Address  formats  are	 of  the  form
       ``host.port''  or  ``network.port''  if	a socket's address specifies a
       network but no specific host address.  When known the host and  network
       addresses  are  displayed  symbolically	according  to  the  data bases
       _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s and _/_e_t_c_/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for  an
       address	is  unknown,  or if the	--nn option is specified,	the address is
       printed numerically, according to the address family.  For more	infor-
       mation  regarding  the  Internet	 ``dot	format,''  refer  to _i_n_e_t(3N).
       Unspecified, or ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear	as ``*''.

       The interface display provides a	table of cumulative statistics regard-
       ing packets transferred,	errors,	and collisions.	 The network addresses
       of the interface	and the	maximum	transmission unit (``mtu'')  are  also
       displayed.

       The routing table display indicates the available routes	and their sta-
       tus.  Each route	consists of a destination host or network and a	 gate-
       way  to	use in forwarding packets.  The	flags field shows the state of
       the route (``U''	if ``up''), whether the	route is to a gateway (``G''),
       and  whether  the  route	was created dynamically	by a redirect (``D'').
       Direct routes are created for each  interface  attached	to  the	 local
       host;  the gateway field	for such entries shows the address of the out-
       going interface.	 The refcnt field gives	the current number  of	active
       uses of the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a
       single route for	the duration of	a connection while connectionless pro-
       tocols  obtain  a route while sending to	the same destination.  The use
       field provides a	count of the number of packets sent using that	route.
       The  interface  entry  indicates	the network interface utilized for the
       route.

       When _n_e_t_s_t_a_t is invoked with an _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l	argument, it displays  a  run-
       ning  count  of statistics related to network interfaces.  This display
       consists	of a column for	the primary  interface	(the  first  interface
       found  during  autoconfiguration)  and a	column summarizing information
       for all interfaces.  The	primary	interface may be replaced with another
       interface  with the _-_I option.  The first line of each screen of	infor-
       mation contains a summary since the system was last  rebooted.	Subse-
       quent lines of output show values accumulated over the preceding	inter-
       val.

       The  notion  of	errors is ill-defined.	Collisions mean	something else
       for the IMP.
