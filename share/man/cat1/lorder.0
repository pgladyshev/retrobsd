       lorder -	find ordering relation for an object library

       The  input  is one or more object or library archive (see _a_r(1))	_f_i_l_e_s_.
       The standard output is a	list of	pairs of object	 file  names,  meaning
       that  the first file of the pair	refers to external identifiers defined
       in the second.  The output may be processed  by	_t_s_o_r_t(1)  to  find  an
       ordering	of a library suitable for one-pass access by _l_d(1).

       This  brash one-liner intends to	build a	new library from existing `.o'
       files.

	      ar cr library `lorder *.o	| tsort`

       The need	for lorder may be vitiated by use of _r_a_n_l_i_b(1),	which converts
       an ordered archive into a randomly accessed library.

BBUUGGSS
       The names of object files, in and out of	libraries, must	end with `.o';
       nonsense	results	otherwise.
