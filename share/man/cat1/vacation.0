       _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n	 returns a message to the sender of a message telling that you
       are on vacation.	 The intended use is in	a _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.  For example,
       your _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file might	have:

	    \eric, "|vacation eric"

       which  would  send  messages to you (assuming your login	name was eric)
       and send	a message back to the sender.

       _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n	expects	a file _._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._m_s_g in	your home directory containing
       a  message to be	sent back to each sender.  It should be	an entire mes-
       sage (including headers).  For example, it might	say:

	    From: eric@ucbmonet.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
	    Subject: I am on vacation
	    Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of:	the Vacation program

	    I am on vacation until July	22.  If	you have something urgent,
	    please contact Joe Kalash <kalash@ucbingres.Berkeley.EDU>.
		 --eric

       This message will only be sent once a week to each unique sender.   The
       people  who  have sent you messages are kept in the files _._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._p_a_g
       and _._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n_._d_i_r in your home directory.  The  --II  option  initializes
       these  files,  and  should  be executed before you modify your _._f_o_r_w_a_r_d
       file.

       If the --II flag is not specified,	_v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n reads the first line from the
       standard	 input for a UNIX-style	``From'' line to determine the sender.
       If this is not present, a nasty diagnostic  is  produced.   _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8)
       includes	the ``From'' line automatically.

       No  message  is	sent  if the initial ``From'' line includes the	string
       ``-REQUEST@'' or	if a ``Precedence: bulk'' or ``Precedence: junk'' line
       is included in the header.
