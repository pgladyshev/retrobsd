       _U_n_i_q  reads  the	 input	file  comparing	adjacent lines.	 In the	normal
       case, the second	and succeeding copies of repeated lines	 are  removed;
       the  remainder is written on the	output file.  Note that	repeated lines
       must be adjacent	in order to be found; see _s_o_r_t(1).  If the --uu flag  is
       used,  just  the	 lines	that are not repeated in the original file are
       output.	The --dd option specifies	that one copy  of  just	 the  repeated
       lines  is to be written.	 The normal mode output	is the union of	the --uu
       and --dd mode outputs.

       The --cc option supersedes	--uu and --dd and generates	an  output  report  in
       default	style  but with	each line preceded by a	count of the number of
       times it	occurred.

       The _n arguments specify skipping	an initial portion of each line	in the
       comparison:

       --_n      The  first  _n  fields  together with any	blanks before each are
	       ignored.	 A field is defined as a string	of non-space,  non-tab
	       characters separated by tabs and	spaces from its	neighbors.

       ++_n      The  first _n characters are ignored.  Fields are	skipped	before
	       characters.
