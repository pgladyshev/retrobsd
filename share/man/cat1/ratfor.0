       _R_a_t_f_o_r  converts	a rational dialect of Fortran into ordinary irrational
       Fortran.	 _R_a_t_f_o_r	provides control flow constructs essentially identical
       to those	in C:

       statement grouping:
	      {	statement; statement; statement	}

       decision-making:
	      if (condition) statement [ else statement	]
	      switch (integer value) {
		   case	integer:  statement
		   ...
		   [ default: ]	  statement
	      }

       loops: while (condition)	statement
	      for (expression; condition; expression) statement
	      do limits	statement
	      repeat statement [ until (condition) ]
	      break
	      next

       and some	syntactic sugar	to make	programs easier	to read	and write:

       free form input:
	      multiple statements/line;	automatic continuation

       comments:
	      #	this is	a comment

       translation of relationals:
	      >, >=, etc., become .GT.,	.GE., etc.

       return (expression)
	      returns expression to caller from	function

       define:
	      define name replacement

       include:
	      include filename

       _R_a_t_f_o_r is best used with	_f_7_7(1).
