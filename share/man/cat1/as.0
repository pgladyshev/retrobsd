       _A_s assembles the	concatenation of the named files.  The options are:

       --uu     Treat all	undefined symbols in the assembly as external globals.

       --VV     Produce  an  object  suitable for	loading	into an	automatic text
	      overlaid program.

       --oo     Use _o_b_j_f_i_l for the name of the resultant	object.	  If  this  is
	      omitted, _a_._o_u_t is	used.  If no errors occurred during the	assem-
	      bly and if there were no unresolved external references,	it  is
	      made executable.

       The  special  file  name	---- serves two purposes.	 It signals the	end of
       all options and causes _s_t_d_i_n to be read for input.  Thus	it is now pos-
       sible to	pipe data to the assembler:

       /lib/cpp	-E foo.s | sed -e ';^#;/;' | as	-o foo.o --

       The  file  name	----  may	 be  placed  between normal files, when	EOF is
       detected	on _s_t_d_i_n the next file in the  argument	 list  is  opened  and
       read.

       If no input files are specified then _s_t_d_i_n is read.

       When an input file cannot be read, its name followed by a question mark
       is typed	and assembly ceases.  When syntactic or	semantic errors	occur,
       a  single-character diagnostic is typed out together with the line num-
       ber and the file	name in	which it occurred.  Errors  in	pass  1	 cause
       cancellation of pass 2.	The possible errors are:

       )  Parentheses error
       ]  Parentheses error
       <  String not terminated	properly
       *  Indirection used illegally
       ..  Illegal assignment to	`..'
       a  Error	in address
       b  Branch instruction is	odd or too remote
       e  Error	in expression
       f  Error	in local (`f' or `b') type symbol
       g  Garbage (unknown) character
       i  End of file inside an	if
       m  Multiply defined symbol as label
       o  Word quantity	assembled at odd address
       p  `..' different	in pass	1 and 2
       r  Relocation error
       u  Undefined symbol
       x  Syntax error

       Syntax  errors  can  cause incorrect line numbers in following diagnos-
       tics.
