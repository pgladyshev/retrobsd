DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Note:  This is the old version 7	UNIX system mail program.  The default
       _m_a_i_l command is described in _M_a_i_l(1), and its binary is in  the	direc-
       tory _/_u_s_r_/_u_c_b.

       _m_a_i_l  with  no  argument	 prints	 a user's mail,	message-by-message, in
       last-in,	first-out order; the optional argument	++  displays  the  mail
       messages	 in  first-in,	first-out order.  For each message, it reads a
       line from the standard input to direct disposition of the message.

       newline
	      Go on to next message.

       d      Delete message and go on to the next.

       p      Print message again.

       -      Go back to previous message.

       s [ _f_i_l_e	] ...
	      Save the message in the named _f_i_l_e_s (`mbox' default).

       w [ _f_i_l_e	] ...
	      Save the message,	without	a header, in the named	_f_i_l_e_s  (`mbox'
	      default).

       m [ _p_e_r_s_o_n ] ...
	      Mail the message to the named _p_e_r_s_o_n_s (yourself is default).

       EOT (control-D)
	      Put unexamined mail back in the mailbox and stop.

       q      Same as EOT.

       !_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	      Escape to	the Shell to do	_c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       *      Print a command summary.

       An  interrupt  normally	terminates  the	_m_a_i_l command; the mail file is
       unchanged.  The optional	argument  --ii  tells  _m_a_i_l  to  continue	 after
       interrupts.

       When  _p_e_r_s_o_n_s are named,	_m_a_i_l takes the standard	input up to an end-of-
       file (or	a line with just `.')  and adds	it  to	each  _p_e_r_s_o_n_'_s	`mail'
       file.   The  message  is	 preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.
       Lines that look like postmarks are prepended with  `>'.	 A  _p_e_r_s_o_n  is
       usually a user name recognized by _l_o_g_i_n(1).  To denote a	recipient on a
       remote system, prefix _p_e_r_s_o_n by the system name	and  exclamation  mark
       (see _u_u_c_p(1C)).

       The --ff option causes the	named file, for	example, `mbox', to be printed
       as if it	were the mail file.

       When a user logs	in he is informed of the presence of mail.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       Mail(1),	write(1), uucp(1C), uux(1C), xsend(1), sendmail(8)

BBUUGGSS
       Race conditions sometimes result	in a failure to	remove a lock file.

       Normally	anybody	can read your mail, unless it is sent by _x_s_e_n_d(1).  An
       installation  can  overcome  this  by making _m_a_i_l a set-user-id command
       that owns the mail directory.
