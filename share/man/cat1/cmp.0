       The  two	 files	are compared.  (If _f_i_l_e_1 is `-', the standard input is
       used.)  Under default options, _c_m_p makes	no comment if  the  files  are
       the  same;  if  they  differ,  it announces the byte and	line number at
       which the difference occurred.  If one file is an  initial  subsequence
       of the other, that fact is noted.

       Options:

       --ll    Print  the	 byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal)
	     for each difference.

       --ss    Print nothing for differing files;	return codes only.

       Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different files, and
       2 for an	inaccessible or	missing	argument.
