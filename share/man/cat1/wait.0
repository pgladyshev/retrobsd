       Wait  until  all	processes started with && have completed, and report on
       abnormal	terminations.

       Because the _w_a_i_t(2) system call must be executed	in the parent process,
       the Shell itself	executes _w_a_i_t_, without creating	a new process.

BBUUGGSS
       Not  all	 the  processes	of a 3-	or more-stage pipeline are children of
       the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.	 (This bug does	not  apply  to
       _c_s_h(1).)
