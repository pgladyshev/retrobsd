       gcore - get core	image of running process

       _g_c_o_r_e  creates a	core image of each specified process, suitable for use
       with _a_d_b(1).  By	 default  the  core  image  is	written	 to  the  file
       _<_p_i_d_>_._c_o_r_e.

       The options are:

       --cc     Write the	core file to the specified file	instead	of _<_p_i_d_>_._c_o_r_e.

       --ss     Stop  the	 process  while	 creating the core image and resume it
	      when done.  This makes sure that the core	dump will be in	a con-
	      sistent  state.	The  process is	resumed	even if	it was already
	      stopped.	Of course, you can obtain the same result by  manually
	      stopping the process with	kill(1).

       The  core  image	name was changed from _c_o_r_e_._<_p_i_d_> to _<_p_i_d_>_._c_o_r_e to pre-
       vent matching names like	_c_o_r_e_._h and _c_o_r_e_._c when using programs such  as
       _f_i_n_d_(_1_).

FFIILLEESS
       <process-id>.core   The core image.

BBUUGGSS
       If  ggccoorree  encounters an	error while creating the core image and	the --ss
       option was used the process will	remain stopped.

       Swapped out processes and system	processes (the	swapper)  may  not  be
       gcore'd.
