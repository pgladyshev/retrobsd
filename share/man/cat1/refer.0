       _R_e_f_e_r is	a preprocessor for _n_r_o_f_f or _t_r_o_f_f(1) that  finds  and  formats
       references for footnotes	or endnotes.  It is also the base for a	series
       of programs designed to index, search, sort, and	print stand-alone bib-
       liographies, or other data entered in the appropriate form.

       Given  an incomplete citation with sufficiently precise keywords, _r_e_f_e_r
       will search a bibliographic database for	 references  containing	 these
       keywords	 anywhere  in the title, author, journal, etc.	The input file
       (or standard input) is copied to	 standard  output,  except  for	 lines
       between	.[  and	 .] delimiters,	which are assumed to contain keywords,
       and are replaced	by information from the	bibliographic  database.   The
       user  may  also search different	databases, override particular fields,
       or add new fields.  The	reference  data,  from	whatever  source,  are
       assigned	to a set of _t_r_o_f_f strings.  Macro packages such	as _m_s(7) print
       the finished reference text from	these strings.	By default  references
       are flagged by footnote numbers.

       The following options are available:

       --aa_n   Reverse  the  first _n author names	(Jones,	J. A. instead of J. A.
	     Jones).  If _n is omitted all author names are reversed.

       --bb    Bare mode:	do not put any flags  in  text	(neither  numbers  nor
	     labels).

       --cc_k_e_y_s
	     Capitalize	 (with	CAPS  SMALL CAPS) the fields whose key-letters
	     are in _k_e_y_s.

       --ee    Instead of	leaving	the references where  encountered,  accumulate
	     them until	a sequence of the form
		  .[
		  $LIST$
		  .]
	     is	 encountered,  and  then write out all references collected so
	     far.  Collapse references to same source.

       --ff_n   Set the footnote number to	_n instead of the default of  1	(one).
	     With labels rather	than numbers, this flag	is a no-op.

       --kk_x   Instead  of  numbering  references,  use labels as	specified in a
	     reference data line beginning _%_x_; by default _x is LL..

       --ll_m,,_n Instead of	numbering references, use labels made from the	senior
	     author's last name	and the	year of	publication.  Only the first _m
	     letters of	the last name and the last _n digits of	the  date  are
	     used.   If	 either	 _m  or	_n  is  omitted the entire name or date
	     respectively is used.

       --nn    Do	not search the default file /usr/dict/papers/Ind.  If there is
	     a REFER environment variable, the specified file will be searched
	     instead of	the default file; in this case	the  --nn	 flag  has  no
	     effect.

       --pp _b_i_b
	     Take  the	next  argument	_b_i_b  as	 a  file  of  references to be
	     searched.	The default file is searched last.

       --ss_k_e_y_s
	     Sort references by	fields	whose  key-letters  are	 in  the  _k_e_y_s
	     string;  permute  reference numbers in text accordingly.  Implies
	     --ee.  The key-letters in _k_e_y_s may be followed by a number to indi-
	     cate  how many such fields	are used, with ++ taken as a very large
	     number.  The default is AADD	which sorts on the senior  author  and
	     then  date;  to sort, for example,	on all authors and then	title,
	     use --ssAA++TT.

       --BB_l_._m Bibliography mode.	 Take a	file composed of records separated  by
	     blank  lines,  and	 turn  them into _t_r_o_f_f input.  Label _l will be
	     turned into the macro _._m with _l defaulting	to %%XX and _._m  default-
	     ing to ..AAPP	(annotation paragraph).

       --PP    Place punctuation marks .,:;?! after the reference	signal,	rather
	     than before.  (Periods and	commas used to be done with strings.)

       --SS    Produce references	in the Natural or Social Science format.

       To use your own references, put them in	the  format  described	below.
       They  can be searched more rapidly by running _i_n_d_x_b_i_b(1)	on them	before
       using _r_e_f_e_r_; failure to index results in	a linear search.   When	 _r_e_f_e_r
       is  used	with the _e_q_n_, _n_e_q_n or _t_b_l preprocessors	_r_e_f_e_r should be	first,
       to minimize the volume of data passed through pipes.

       The _r_e_f_e_r preprocessor and associated programs expect input from	a file
       of  references  composed	of records separated by	blank lines.  A	record
       is a set	of lines (fields), each	containing one	kind  of  information.
       Fields  start  on a line	beginning with a ``%'',	followed by a key-let-
       ter, then a blank, and finally the contents of the field, and  continue
       until  the next line starting with ``%''.  The output ordering and for-
       matting of fields is controlled by the macros specified for _n_r_o_f_f_/_t_r_o_f_f
       (for  footnotes	and  endnotes)	or _r_o_f_f_b_i_b (for	stand-alone bibliogra-
       phies).	For a list of the most common  key-letters  and	 their	corre-
       sponding	 fields,  see _a_d_d_b_i_b(1).  An example of	a _r_e_f_e_r	entry is given
       below.

       Blank spaces at the end of lines	in bibliography	fields will cause  the
       records to sort and reverse incorrectly.	 Sorting large numbers of ref-
       erences causes a	core dump.
