       The  iidd	utility	 displays the user and group names and numeric IDs, of
       the calling process, to the standard output.  If	the real and effective
       IDs  are	 different,  both are displayed, otherwise only	the real ID is
       displayed.

       If a _u_s_e_r (login	name or	user ID) is specified, the user	and group  IDs
       of  that	 user are displayed.  In this case, the	real and effective IDs
       are assumed to be the same.

       The options are as follows:

       --GG	 Display the different group IDs (effective, real and  supple-
		 mentary)  as  white-space separated numbers, in no particular
		 order.

       --gg	 Display the effective group ID	as a number.

       --nn	 Display the name of the user or group ID for the --GGPP,, --gg  aanndd

       --pp	 Make the output human-readable.  If the user name returned by
		 getlogin(2) is	different from the login  name	referenced  by
		 the  user  ID,	the name returned by getlogin(2) is displayed,
		 preceded by the keyword ``login''.  The user ID as a name  is
		 displayed, preceded by	the keyword ``uid''.  If the effective
		 user ID is different from the real user ID, the real user  ID
		 is displayed as a name, preceded by the keyword ``euid''.  If
		 the effective group ID	is different from the real  group  ID,
		 the  real  group  ID  is displayed as a name, preceded	by the
		 keyword ``rgid''.  The	list  of  groups  to  which  the  user
		 belongs  is  then displayed as	names, preceded	by the keyword
		 ``groups''.  Each display is on a separate line.

       --rr	 Display the real ID for the --gg	and --uu options instead of  the
		 effective ID.

       --uu	 Display the effective user ID as a number.

       The iidd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

       The iidd function is expected to conform to IEEE Std1003.2	(``POSIX'').

       The historic groups(1) command is equivalent to ``iidd --GGnn	[uusseerr]''.

       The historic whoami(1) command is equivalent to ``iidd --uunn''.

       The iidd command first appeared in	4.4BSD.
