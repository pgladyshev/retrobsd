       _S_p_e_l_l collects words from the named documents, and looks	them up	 in  a
       spelling	 list.	 Words	that neither occur among nor are derivable (by
       applying	certain	inflections, prefixes or suffixes) from	words  in  the
       spelling	 list  are  printed  on	 the standard output.  If no files are
       named, words are	collected from the standard input.

       _S_p_e_l_l ignores most _t_r_o_f_f_, _t_b_l and _e_q_n(1)	constructions.

       Under the --vv option, all	words not literally in the spelling  list  are
       printed,	 and  plausible	derivations from spelling list words are indi-
       cated.

       Under the --bb option, British spelling is	checked.   Besides  preferring
       _c_e_n_t_r_e_,	_c_o_l_o_u_r_,	 _s_p_e_c_i_a_l_i_t_y_, _t_r_a_v_e_l_l_e_d_,	etc., this option insists upon
       _-_i_s_e in words like _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_i_s_e_, Fowler and the OED to the contrary not-
       withstanding.

       Under  the --xx option, every plausible stem is printed with `=' for each
       word.

       The spelling list is based on many sources.  While it is	more haphazard
       than  an	 ordinary  dictionary,	it  is also more effective with	proper
       names and popular technical words.  Coverage of the specialized vocabu-
       laries of biology, medicine and chemistry is light.

       The  auxiliary files used for the spelling list,	stop list, and history
       file may	be specified  by  arguments  following	the  --dd,  --ss,  and  --hh
       options.	  The default files are	indicated below.  Copies of all	output
       may be accumulated in the history file.	The stop list filters out mis-
       spellings (e.g. thier=thy-y+ier)	that would otherwise pass.

       Two routines help maintain the hash lists used by _s_p_e_l_l_.	 Both expect a
       set of words, one per line, from	the standard input.  _S_p_e_l_l_i_n  combines
       the  words  from	 the  standard input and the preexisting _l_i_s_t file and
       places a	new list on the	standard output.  If no	_l_i_s_t  file  is	speci-
       fied,  the  new	list  is created from scratch.	_S_p_e_l_l_o_u_t looks up each
       word from the standard input and	prints on the  standard	 output	 those
       that  are  missing from (or present on, with option --dd) the hashed _l_i_s_t
       file.  For example, to verify that _h_o_o_k_e_y is not	on the default	spell-
       ing list, add it	to your	own private list, and then use it with _s_p_e_l_l,

	      echo  hookey  |  spellin	/usr/dict/hlista  >  myhlist
	      spell  -d	 myhlist  huckfinn

BBUUGGSS
       The spelling list's coverage is uneven; new installations will probably
       wish  to	 monitor  the  output for several months to gather local addi-
       tions.
