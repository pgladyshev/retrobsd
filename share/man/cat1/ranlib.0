       _R_a_n_l_i_b  creates	a  table of external references	for archive libraries,
       normally	 used  by  the	loader,	 _l_d(1)_.	  This	table  is   is	 named
       ``__.SYMDEF''  and  is  prepended to the	archive.  Files	in the archive
       which are not executable	and symbols which  are	uninteresting  to  the
       loader are ignored.

       The options are as follows:

       -t     Set  the	modification time of the __.SYMDEF file.  This time is
	      compared by the loader with the modification time	of the archive
	      to  verify  that the table is up-to-date with respect to the ar-
	      chive.  If the modification time has been	 changed  without  any
	      change  to  the archive (for example, by a _c_p(1)_), the _-_t	option
	      can be used to  ``touch''	 the  modification  time  so  that  it
	      appears that the table is	up-to-date.
