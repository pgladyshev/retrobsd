       The  _l_o_g_i_n command is used when a user initially	signs on, or it	may be
       used at any time	to change from one user	to another.  The  latter  case
       is  the	one  summarized	 above	and  described	here.  See "How	to Get
       Started"	for how	to dial	up initially.

       If _l_o_g_i_n	is invoked without an argument,	it asks	for a user name,  and,
       if appropriate, a password.  Echoing is turned off (if possible)	during
       the typing of the password, so it will not appear on the	written	record
       of the session.

       After  a	successful login, accounting files are updated and the user is
       informed	of the existence of mail.  The message of the day is  printed,
       as  is  the  time  of  his last login.  Both are	suppressed if he has a
       ".hushlogin" file in his	home directory;	this is	mostly	used  to  make
       life easier for non-human users,	such as	_u_u_c_p.

       _L_o_g_i_n  initializes  the	user  and group	IDs and	the working directory,
       then executes a command interpreter (usually _c_s_h(1)) according to spec-
       ifications  found in a password file.  Argument 0 of the	command	inter-
       preter is the name of the  command  interpreter	with  a	 leading  dash
       ("-").

       Login  also modifies the	environment _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7) with information	speci-
       fying home directory, command interpreter, terminal type	(if available)
       and  user name.	The `-p' argument causes the remainder of the environ-
       ment to be preserved, otherwise any previous environment	is discarded.

       If the file /etc/nologin	exists,	 _l_o_g_i_n	prints	its  contents  on  the
       user's  terminal	 and  exits. This is used by _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(8) to stop users
       logging in when the system is about to go down.

       Login is	recognized by _s_h(1) and	_c_s_h(1) and executed directly  (without
       forking).

       An  undocumented	 option,  --rr  is  used	by  the	 remote	 login server,
       _r_l_o_g_i_n_d(8C) to force _l_o_g_i_n to enter into	an initial  connection	proto-
