       _M_a_n  is	the  program which provides on-line access to the UNIX manual.
       If a _s_e_c_t_i_o_n specifier is given,	_m_a_n looks in that section of the  man-
       ual for the given _t_i_t_l_e(s).  _S_e_c_t_i_o_n is either an Arabic	section	number
       (``3'' for example),  or	 one  of  the  words  ``local'',  ``new,''  or
       ``old''.	 (The abbreviations ``l'', ``n'', and ``o'' are	also allowed.)
       If _s_e_c_t_i_o_n is omitted, _m_a_n searches all sections	of the manual,	giving
       preference to commands over library subroutines,	and displays the first
       manual page it finds, if	any.  If the _-_a	option is supplied,  _m_a_n  dis-
       plays all applicable manual pages.

       Normally	_m_a_n checks in standard locations (/usr/man and /usr/local/man)
       for manual information.	This can be changed by supplying a search path
       (a  la  the Bourne shell) with the --MM flag.  The	search path is a colon
       (``:'') separated list of directories in	which _m_a_n expects to find  the
       standard	 manual	subdirectories.	 This search path can also be set with
       the environmental variable _M_A_N_P_A_T_H.

       Since some manual pages are intended for	use only on certain  machines,
       _m_a_n  only searches those	directories applicable to the current machine.
       _M_a_n's determination of the current machine type can  be	overridden  by
       setting the environmental variable _M_A_C_H_I_N_E.

       If  the	standard output	is a teletype, and the -- flag is not provided,
       _m_a_n uses	_m_o_r_e(1), or the	pager provided by the  environmental  variable
       _P_A_G_E_R, to display the manual page.

       The FORTRAN version of section 3	of the manual may be specified by sup-
       plying _m_a_n with the _s_e_c_t_i_o_n ``3f''.  Also, a specific  section  of  the
       local  manual  may  be  specified by appending a	number to the _s_e_c_t_i_o_n,
       i.e. ``l5'' would indicate section 5 of the local manual.

       The manual is supposed to be reproducible either	on the phototypesetter
       or  on a	typewriter, however, on	a typewriter, some information is nec-
       essarily	lost.
