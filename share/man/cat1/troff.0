       _T_r_o_f_f formats text in the named _f_i_l_e_s for printing on a Graphic Systems
       C/A/T phototypesetter; _n_r_o_f_f is used for	for  typewriter-like  devices.
       Their capabilities are described	in the _N_r_o_f_f_/_T_r_o_f_f _u_s_e_r_'_s _m_a_n_u_a_l_.

       If  no  _f_i_l_e argument is	present, the standard input is read.  An argu-
       ment consisting of a single minus (--) is	taken to be a file name	corre-
       sponding	 to  the standard input.  The options, which may appear	in any
       order so	long as	they appear before the files, are:

       --oo_l_i_s_t Print only pages whose page numbers appear  in  the  comma-sepa-
	      rated  _l_i_s_t  of  numbers	and ranges.  A range _N--_M means pages _N
	      through _M; an initial _-_N means from the beginning	to page	_N; and
	      a	final _N- means from _N to the end.

       --nn_N    Number first generated page _N.

       --ss_N    Stop  every  _N  pages.   _N_r_o_f_f  will halt	prior to every _N pages
	      (default _N=1) to allow  paper  loading  or  changing,  and  will
	      resume  upon  receipt  of	a newline.  _T_r_o_f_f will stop the	photo-
	      typesetter every _N pages,	produce	a trailer  to  allow  changing
	      cassettes,  and  resume  when  the  typesetter's start button is
	      pressed.

       --mm_n_a_m_e Prepend the macro	file //uussrr//sshhaarree//ttmmaacc//ttmmaacc.._n_a_m_e	to  the	 input
	      _f_i_l_e_s.

       --rr_a_N   Set register _a (one-character) to	_N.

       --ii     Read standard input after	the input files	are exhausted.

       --qq     Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode	of the rrdd request.

       _T_T_r_r_o_o_f_f_f_f _o_o_n_n_l_l_y_y

       --tt     Direct  output  to the standard output instead of	the phototype-
	      setter.

       --ff     Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping  phototypesetter  at
	      the end of the run.

       --ww     Wait until phototypesetter is available, if currently busy.

       --bb     Report  whether  the  phototypesetter  is	busy or	available.  No
	      text processing is done.

       --aa     Send a printable ASCII approximation of the results to the stan-
	      dard output.

       --ppN    Print  all  characters  in point size _N while retaining all pre-
	      scribed spacings and motions, to reduce phototypesetter  elapsed
	      time.

       --FF_f_o_n_t_d_i_r
	      The  directory _f_o_n_t_d_i_r contains the font width tables instead of
	      the default directory /usr/share/fonts. This option can be  used
	      to produce output	for devices besides the	phototypesetter.

       If  the	file  _/_u_s_r_/_a_d_m_/_t_r_a_c_c_t is writable, _t_r_o_f_f keeps phototypesetter
       accounting records there.  The integrity	of that	file may be secured by
       making _t_r_o_f_f a 'set user-id' program.
