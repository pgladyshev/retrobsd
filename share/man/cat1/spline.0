       _S_p_l_i_n_e  takes  pairs of numbers from the	standard input as abcissas and
       ordinates of a function.	 It produces a similar set, which is  approxi-
       mately  equally spaced and includes the input set, on the standard out-
       put.  The cubic spline output (R. W.  Hamming,  _N_u_m_e_r_i_c_a_l  _M_e_t_h_o_d_s  _f_o_r
       _S_c_i_e_n_t_i_s_t_s  _a_n_d	_E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_s_,  2nd	ed., 349ff) has	two continuous deriva-
       tives, and sufficiently many points to look smooth  when	 plotted,  for
       example by _g_r_a_p_h(1G).

       The following options are recognized, each as a separate	argument.

       --aa   Supply  abscissas automatically (they are missing from the input);
	    spacing is given by	the next argument, or is assumed to  be	 1  if
	    next argument is not a number.

       --kk   The	constant _k used	in the boundary	value computation

		     (2nd deriv. at end) = k*(2nd deriv. next to end)

	    is set by the next argument.  By default _k = 0.

       --nn   Space  output  points  so  that  approximately  _n  intervals occur
	    between the	lower and upper	_x limits.  (Default _n =	100.)

       --pp   Make output	periodic, i.e. match derivatives at ends.   First  and
	    last input values should normally agree.

       --xx   Next  1 (or	2) arguments are lower (and upper) _x limits.  Normally
	    these limits are calculated	from  the  data.   Automatic  abcissas
	    start at lower limit (default 0).

       When  data  is  not strictly monotone in	_x_, _s_p_l_i_n_e reproduces the input
       without interpolating extra points.

       A limit of 1000 input points is enforced	silently.
