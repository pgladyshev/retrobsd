       _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e	and _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e are used to send  a  binary  file	via  uucp  (or
       other)  mail.   This  combination  can be used over indirect mail links
       even when _u_u_s_e_n_d(1C) is not available.

       _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e	takes the named	source file (default standard input) and  pro-
       duces  an  encoded  version  on the standard output.  The encoding uses
       only printing ASCII characters, and includes the	mode of	the  file  and
       the _r_e_m_o_t_e_d_e_s_t for recreation on	the remote system.

       _U_u_d_e_c_o_d_e	 reads	an  encoded  file, strips off any leading and trailing
       lines added by mailers, and recreates the original file with the	speci-
       fied mode and name.

       The  intent  is that all	mail to	the user ``decode'' should be filtered
       through the _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e program.  This way the file	is  created  automati-
       cally without human intervention.  This is possible on the uucp network
       by either using _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l	or by making _r_m_a_i_l be a	link to	 _M_a_i_l  instead
       of  _m_a_i_l.   In  each case, an alias must	be created in a	master file to
       get the automatic invocation of _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e.

       If these	facilities are not available, the file can be sent to  a  user
       on the remote machine who can uudecode it manually.

       The encode file has an ordinary text form and can be edited by any text
       editor to change	the mode or remote name.

       The file	is expanded by 35% (3 bytes become 4 plus control information)
       causing it to take longer to transmit.

       The  user  on  the  remote system who is	invoking _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e (often _u_u_c_p)
       must have write permission on the specified file.
