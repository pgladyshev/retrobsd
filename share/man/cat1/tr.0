       _T_r  copies  the standard	input to the standard output with substitution
       or deletion of selected characters.  Input characters found in  _s_t_r_i_n_g_1
       are  mapped into	the corresponding characters of	_s_t_r_i_n_g_2.  When _s_t_r_i_n_g_2
       is short	it is padded to	the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 by duplicating its  last
       character.  Any combination of the options --ccddss may be used: --cc comple-
       ments the set of	characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 with respect to the universe  of
       characters  whose ASCII codes are 01 through 0377 octal;	--dd deletes all
       input characters	in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1_; --ss squeezes	all strings of repeated	output
       characters that are in _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 to single	characters.

       In either string	the notation _a--_b means a range of characters from _a to
       _b in increasing ASCII order.  The character `\' followed	by 1, 2	 or  3
       octal  digits  stands  for  the	character whose	ASCII code is given by
       those digits.  A	`\' followed by	any other character  stands  for  that
       character.

       The  following  example	creates	a list of all the words	in `file1' one
       per line	in `file2', where a word is taken to be	a  maximal  string  of
       alphabetics.   The  second  string  is  quoted  to protect `\' from the
       Shell.  012 is the ASCII	code for newline.

	      tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' <file1 >file2

       Won't handle ASCII NUL in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 or _s_t_r_i_n_g_2_; always deletes  NUL  from
       input.
