       symcompact  reduces  the	symbol table size of an	executable file.  This
       is done by removing unnecessary overlay transfer	vectors	(text  symbols
       beginning with a	tilde).	 In a nonoverlaid program there	is no need for
       both the	underscore (_foo) and tilde (~foo) text	symbol	and  only  the
       underscore form is kept.	 For overlaid programs if the symbol is	in the
       base segment the	tilde form is not needed and again only	the underscore
       form  is	 preserved.   Running  ssyymmccoommppaacctt typically reduces the	kernel
       symbol table size by 250	or so symbols.

       It is possible to run both ssyymmccoommppaacctt and ssttrrccoommppaacctt to achieve an even
       higher  degree  of  symbol  and	string	table  compaction.  The	normal
       sequence	is to run ssyymmccoommppaacctt first followed by ssttrrccoommppaacctt.  If ssyymmccoomm--
       ppaacctt  runs  out of memory it will be necessary to reverse the order and
       run ssyymmccoommppaacctt a	second time - see the BUGS note	below.

       The user	must have write	permission to the object/executable file.

       ssyymmccoommppaacctt writes to _s_t_d_e_r_r the count of	symbols	removed	from the  sym-
       bol table.

       ssyymmccoommppaacctt exits	0 if successful, and >0	if an error occurred.

       This  program  can  partially negate the	benefits of ssttrrccoommppaacctt because
       multiple	references to identical	strings	cause additional strings to be
       placed  in  the	string	table.	Running	ssttrrccoommppaacctt again after running
       this program fixes this problem.

       The _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r local symbol type is removed  from	the  executable/object
       file.   Since  the  debugger really doesn't know	how to deal with those
       symbols this is not much	of a loss and saves quite a bit	of space  both
       in the symbol table and the string table.

       ssyymmccoommppaacctt  should  not	be  run	on .o files that will be passed	to the
       linker.	The linker will	need the tilde form of the symbol if an	 over-
       laid executable is being	created.
