       _P_x_p can be used to obtain execution profiles of Pascal programs or as a
       pretty-printer.	To produce an execution	profile	all that is  necessary
       is  to  translate  the program specifying the zz option to _p_i or _p_i_x_, to
       execute the program, and	to then	issue the command

	    ppxxpp	--zz name.p

       A reformatted listing is	output if none of the cc, tt, or zz  options  are
       specified; thus

	    ppxxpp	old.p >	new.p

       places  a  pretty-printed version of the	program	in `old.p' in the file
       `new.p'.

       The use of the following	options	of _p_x_p is discussed in	sections  2.6,
       5.4, 5.5	and 5.10 of the	_B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _P_a_s_c_a_l	_U_s_e_r_'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l.

       --aa    Print  the	bodies of all procedures and functions in the profile;
	     even those	which were never executed.

       --cc    Extract profile data from the file	_c_o_r_e.

       --dd    Include declaration parts in a profile.

       --ee    Eliminate	iinncclluuddee	 directives  when  reformatting	 a  file;  the
	     iinncclluuddee  is replaced by the reformatted contents of the specified
	     file.

       --ff    Fully parenthesize	expressions.

       --jj    Left justify all procedures and functions.

       --nn    Eject a new page as each file is included;	in profiles,  print  a
	     blank line	at the top of the page.

       --ss    Strip comments from the input text.

       --tt    Print a table summarizing pprroocceedduurree and ffuunnccttiioonn call counts.

       --uu    Card  image mode; only the	first 72 characters of input lines are
	     used.

       --ww    Suppress warning diagnostics.

       --zz    Generate an execution profile.  If	no _n_a_m_es, are given  the  pro-
	     file is of	the entire program.  If	a list of names	is given, then
	     only any specified	pprroocceedduurrees or ffuunnccttiioonns	and  the  contents  of
	     any specified iinncclluuddee files will appear in	the profile.

       --__    Underline keywords.

       --_d    With  _d  a	 digit,	2 <= _d <= 9, causes _p_x_p	to use _d spaces	as the
	     basic indenting unit.  The	default	is 4.

       Error diagnostics include `No profile data in file' with	the  cc	option
       if  the zz option	was not	enabled	to _p_i_; `Not a Pascal system core file'
       if the core is not from a _p_x execution; `Program	and count data do  not
       correspond'  if	the program was	changed	after compilation, before pro-
       filing; or if the wrong program is specified.
