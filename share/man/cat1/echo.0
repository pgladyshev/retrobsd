       _E_c_h_o  writes its	arguments separated by blanks and terminated by	a new-
       line on the standard output.  If	the flag --nn is	used,  no  newline  is
       added to	the output.

       _E_c_h_o  is	 useful	 for  producing	 diagnostics in	shell programs and for
       writing constant	data on	pipes.	To send	diagnostics  to	 the  standard
       error file, do `echo ...	1>&2'.
