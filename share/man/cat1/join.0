       _J_o_i_n  forms, on the standard output, a join of the two relations	speci-
       fied by the lines of _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2.  If _f_i_l_e_1 is  `-',	 the  standard
       input is	used.

       _F_i_l_e_1  and  _f_i_l_e_2 must be sorted	in increasing ASCII collating sequence
       on the fields on	which they are to be joined,  normally	the  first  in
       each line.

       There  is  one  line  in	the output for each pair of lines in _f_i_l_e_1 and
       _f_i_l_e_2 that have identical join fields.  The output line	normally  con-
       sists  of  the common field, then the rest of the line from _f_i_l_e_1, then
       the rest	of the line from _f_i_l_e_2.

       Fields are normally separated by	blank, tab or newline.	In this	 case,
       multiple	separators count as one, and leading separators	are discarded.

       These options are recognized:

       --aa_n    In  addition  to	the  normal  output,  produce  a line for each
	      unpairable line in file _n, where _n is 1 or 2.

       --ee _s   Replace empty output fields by string _s.

       --jj_n _m  Join on the _mth field of file _n.	If _n is	missing, use  the  _mth
	      field in each file.

       --oo _l_i_s_t
	      Each  output  line  comprises the	fields specified in _l_i_s_t, each
	      element of which has the form _n._m, where _n is a file number  and
	      _m	is a field number.

       --tt_c    Use  character  _c	as a separator (tab character).	 Every appear-
	      ance of _c	in a line is significant.

BBUUGGSS
       With default field  separation,	the  collating	sequence  is  that  of
       _s_o_r_t _-_b;	with --tt, the sequence is that of a plain sort.

       The  conventions	 of _j_o_i_n_, _s_o_r_t_,	_c_o_m_m_, _u_n_i_q_, _l_o_o_k and _a_w_k(1) are	wildly
       incongruous.
