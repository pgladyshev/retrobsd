       _S_t_r_i_n_g_s	looks  for  ascii  strings  in a binary	file.  A string	is any
       sequence	of 4 or	more printing characters ending	with a	newline	 or  a
       null.   Unless  the -- flag is given, _s_t_r_i_n_g_s only looks in the initial-
       ized data space of object files.	 If the	--oo flag	is  given,  then  each
       string  is preceded by its offset in the	file (in octal).  If the --_n_u_m_-
       _b_e_r flag	is given then number is	used  as  the  minimum	string	length
       rather than 4.

       _S_t_r_i_n_g_s	is  useful  for	identifying random object files	and many other
       things.

       The algorithm for identifying strings is	extremely primitive.
