       _R_l_o_g_i_n connects your terminal on	the current local host system _l_h_o_s_t to
       the remote host system _r_h_o_s_t_.

       Each host has a file _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s_._e_q_u_i_v which contains a list of  _r_h_o_s_t's
       with  which it shares account names.  (The host names must be the stan-
       dard names as described in _r_s_h(1C).)  When you _r_l_o_g_i_n as	the same  user
       on  an  equivalent  host, you don't need	to give	a password.  Each user
       may also	have a private equivalence list	in a file .rhosts in his login
       directory.   Each line in this file should contain an _r_h_o_s_t and a _u_s_e_r_-
       _n_a_m_e separated by a space, giving additional cases where	logins without
       passwords  are to be permitted.	If the originating user	is not equiva-
       lent to the remote user,	then a login and password will be prompted for
       on the remote machine as	in _l_o_g_i_n(1).  To avoid some security problems,
       the .rhosts file	must be	owned by either	the remote user	or root.

       The remote terminal type	is the same as your local  terminal  type  (as
       given  in your environment TERM variable).  The terminal	or window size
       is also copied to the remote system if the server supports the  option,
       and  changes in size are	reflected as well.  All	echoing	takes place at
       the remote site,	so that	(except	for delays) the	rlogin is transparent.
       Flow  control  via ^S and ^Q and	flushing of input and output on	inter-
       rupts are handled properly.  The	optional argument --88 allows an	eight-
       bit  input  data	 path at all times; otherwise parity bits are stripped
       except when the remote side's stop and start characters are other  than
       ^S/^Q.	The  argument --LL allows	the rlogin session to be run in	litout
       mode.  A	line of	the form ``~.''	 disconnects  from  the	 remote	 host,
       where  ``~''  is	 the  escape  character.   Similarly, the line ``~^Z''
       (where ^Z, control-Z, is	the suspend character) will suspend the	rlogin
       session.	  Substitution	of the delayed-suspend character (normally ^Y)
       for the suspend character suspends the send portion of the rlogin,  but
       allows output from the remote system.  A	different escape character may
       be specified by the --ee option.	There  is  no  space  separating  this
       option flag and the argument character.
