       _S_o_r_t sorts lines	of all the named files together	and writes the	result
       on  the standard	output.	 The name `-' means the	standard input.	 If no
       input files are named, the standard input is sorted.

       The default sort	key is an entire line.	Default	 ordering  is  lexico-
       graphic	by  bytes  in  machine	collating  sequence.   The ordering is
       affected	globally by the	following options, one or more	of  which  may
       appear.

       bb    Ignore leading blanks (spaces and tabs) in field comparisons.

       dd    `Dictionary'  order:  only letters,	digits and blanks are signifi-
	    cant in comparisons.

       ff    Fold upper case letters onto lower case.

       ii    Ignore characters outside the ASCII	range 040-0176	in  nonnumeric
	    comparisons.

       nn    An initial numeric string, consisting of optional blanks, optional
	    minus sign,	and zero or more digits	with optional  decimal	point,
	    is sorted by arithmetic value.  Option nn implies option bb..

       rr    Reverse the	sense of comparisons.

       tt_x   `Tab character' separating fields is _x.

       The  notation  ++_p_o_s_1 --_p_o_s_2 restricts a sort key to a field beginning at
       _p_o_s_1 and	ending just before _p_o_s_2.  _P_o_s_1 and _p_o_s_2	 each  have  the  form
       _m.._n,  optionally	 followed  by one or more of the flags bbddffiinnrr,, where _m
       tells a number of fields	to skip	from the beginning of the line	and  _n
       tells a number of characters to skip further.  If any flags are present
       they override all the global ordering options for this key.  If	the  bb
       option  is in effect _n is counted from the first	nonblank in the	field;
       bb is attached independently to _p_o_s_2.  A missing .._n means	.0; a  missing
       --_p_o_s_2  means  the  end  of  the line.  Under the	--tt_x option, fields are
       strings separated by _x; otherwise fields	are nonempty nonblank  strings
       separated by blanks.

       When  there  are	multiple sort keys, later keys are compared only after
       all earlier keys	compare	equal.	Lines that otherwise compare equal are
       ordered with all	bytes significant.

       These option arguments are also understood:

       cc    Check  that	 the  input  file  is sorted according to the ordering
	    rules; give	no output unless the file is out of sort.

       mm    Merge only,	the input files	are already sorted.

       oo    The	next argument is the name of an	output file to use instead  of
	    the	 standard  output.   This  file	 may be	the same as one	of the
	    inputs.

       TT    The	next argument is the name of a directory  in  which  temporary
	    files should be made.

       uu    Suppress  all  but	one in each set	of equal lines.	 Ignored bytes
	    and	bytes outside keys do not participate in this comparison.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Print in	alphabetical order all the  unique  spellings  in  a  list  of
       words.  Capitalized words differ	from uncapitalized.

	       sort -u +0f +0 list

       Print  the  password file (_p_a_s_s_w_d(5)) sorted by user id number (the 3rd
       colon-separated field).

	       sort -t:	+2n /etc/passwd

       Print the first instance	of each	month in an  already  sorted  file  of
       (month day) entries.  The options --uumm with just one input file make the
       choice of a unique representative  from	a  set	of  equal  lines  pre-
       dictable.

	       sort -um	+0 -1 dates

FFIILLEESS
       /usr/tmp/stm*, /tmp/*	first and second tries for temporary files

       Comments	 and  exits with nonzero status	for various trouble conditions
       and for disorder	discovered under option	--cc.

       Very long lines are silently truncated.
