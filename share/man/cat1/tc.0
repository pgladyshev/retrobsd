       _T_c  interprets its input	(standard input	default) as device codes for a
       Graphic Systems phototypesetter (cat).  The standard output  of	_t_c  is
       intended	for a Tektronix	4015 (a	4014 terminal with ASCII and APL char-
       acter sets).  The sixteen typesetter sizes are mapped into  the	4014's
       four  sizes;  the  entire TROFF character set is	drawn using the	4014's
       character generator, using  overstruck  combinations  where  necessary.
       Typical usage:

		      troff -t file | tc

       At  the	end  of	each page _t_c waits for a newline (empty	line) from the
       keyboard	before continuing on to	the next page.	In  this  wait	state,
       the  command  ee will suppress the screen	erase before the next page; ssN
       will cause the next N pages to be skipped; and !!line will send line  to
       the shell.

       The command line	options	are:

       --tt     Don't wait between pages;	for directing output into a file.

       --ssN    Skip the first N pages.

       --ppL    Set  page	 length	 to  L.	  L  may  include  the scale factors pp
	      (points),	ii (inches), cc (centimeters), and PP (picas); default is
	      picas.

       ''--_l _w'' Multiply	the  default aspect ratio, 1.5,	of a displayed page by
	      _l_/_w_.

       Font distinctions are lost.
       _t_c's character set is limited to	ASCII in just one size.
       The aspect ratio	option is unbelievable.
