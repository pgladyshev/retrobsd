       When  this program starts up, answering ``y'' to	the initial ``Instruc-
       tions?''	prompt yields directions; typing ``n'' or RETURN  skips	 them.
       _A_d_d_b_i_b  then  prompts for various bibliographic fields, reads responses
       from the	terminal, and sends output records  to	a  _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_.   A  null
       response	(just RETURN) means to leave out that field.  A	minus sign (-)
       means to	go back	to the previous	field.	A trailing backslash allows  a
       field  to  be  continued	on the next line.  The repeating ``Continue?''
       prompt allows the user either to	resume by typing ``y'' or  RETURN,  to
       quit the	current	session	by typing ``n''	or ``q'', or to	edit the _d_a_t_a_-
       _b_a_s_e with any system editor _(_v_i_,	_e_x_, _e_d_i_t_, _e_d_)_.

       The --aa option suppresses	prompting  for	an  abstract;  asking  for  an
       abstract	 is  the  default.  Abstracts are ended	with a CTRL-d.	The --pp
       option causes _a_d_d_b_i_b to	use  a	new  prompting	skeleton,  defined  in
       _p_r_o_m_p_t_f_i_l_e_.   This  file	 should	contain	prompt strings,	a tab, and the
       key-letters to be written to the	_d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_.

       The most	common key-letters and their meanings are given	below.	_A_d_d_b_i_b
       insulates  you  from  these  key-letters, since it gives	you prompts in
       English,	but if you edit	the bibliography file later on,	you will  need
       to know this information.

	    %A	 Author's name
	    %B	 Book containing article referenced
	    %C	 City (place of	publication)
	    %D	 Date of publication
	    %E	 Editor	of book	containing article referenced
	    %F	 Footnote number or label (supplied by _r_e_f_e_r)
	    %G	 Government order number
	    %H	 Header	commentary, printed before reference
	    %I	 Issuer	(publisher)
	    %J	 Journal containing article
	    %K	 Keywords to use in locating reference
	    %L	 Label field used by --kk	option of _r_e_f_e_r
	    %M	 Bell Labs Memorandum (undefined)
	    %N	 Number	within volume
	    %O	 Other commentary, printed at end of reference
	    %P	 Page number(s)
	    %Q	 Corporate or Foreign Author (unreversed)
	    %R	 Report, paper,	or thesis (unpublished)
	    %S	 Series	title
	    %T	 Title of article or book

	    %Y,Z ignored by _r_e_f_e_r

       Except  for  `A',  each field should be given just once.	 Only relevant
       fields should be	supplied.  An example is:

	    %A	 Bill Tuthill
	    %T	 Refer -- A Bibliography System
	    %I	 Computing Services
	    %C	 Berkeley
	    %D	 1982
