       _l_p_q examines the	spooling area used by _l_p_d(8) for printing files	on the
       line printer, and reports the status of the specified jobs or all  jobs
       associated  with	 a user.  _l_p_q invoked without any arguments reports on
       any jobs	currently in the queue.	 A --PP flag may be used	to  specify  a
       particular  printer, otherwise the default line printer is used (or the
       value of	the PRINTER variable in	the environment).  If a	++ argument  is
       supplied,  _l_p_q  displays	the spool queue	until it empties.  Supplying a
       number immediately after	the ++ sign indicates that _l_p_q should  sleep  _n
       seconds	in  between  scans of the queue.  All other arguments supplied
       are interpreted as user names or	job numbers to filter out  only	 those
       jobs of interest.

       For  each  job  submitted  (i.e.	 invocation of _l_p_r(1)) _l_p_q reports the
       user's name, current rank in the	queue, the names of  files  comprising
       the  job, the job identifier (a number which may	be supplied to _l_p_r_m(1)
       for removing a specific job), and the total  size  in  bytes.   The  --ll
       option causes information about each of the files comprising the	job to
       be printed.  Normally, only as much information as will fit on one line
       is  displayed.  Job ordering is dependent on the	algorithm used to scan
       the spooling directory and is supposed to be FIFO (First	in First Out).
       File  names comprising a	job may	be unavailable (when _l_p_r(1) is used as
       a sink in a pipeline) in	which case the file is indicated  as  ``(stan-
       dard input)".

       If _l_p_q warns that there is no daemon present (i.e. due to some malfunc-
       tion), the _l_p_c(8) command can be	used to	restart	the printer daemon.

BBUUGGSS
       Due to the dynamic nature of the	information in the spooling  directory
       lpq  may	report unreliably.  Output formatting is sensitive to the line
       length of the terminal; this can	results	in widely spaced columns.

       files  when there is no daemon active, but files	in the spooling	direc-
       tory.
