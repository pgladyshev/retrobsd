       _R_u_p_t_i_m_e	gives  a status	line like _u_p_t_i_m_e for each machine on the local
       network;	these are formed from packets broadcast	by each	 host  on  the
       network once a minute.

       Machines	 for  which  no	status report has been received	for 11 minutes
       are shown as being down.

       Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the --aa	flag is	given.

       Normally, the listing is	sorted by host name.  The --ll ,,	--tt  ,,  and  --uu
       flags  specify  sorting	by  load average, uptime, and number of	users,
       respectively.  The --rr flag reverses the sort order.
