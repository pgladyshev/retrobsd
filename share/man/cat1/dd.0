       _D_d  copies the specified	input file to the specified output with	possi-
       ble conversions.	 The standard input and	output are  used  by  default.
       The  input  and output block size may be	specified to take advantage of
       raw physical I/O.

       _o_p_t_i_o_n	      _v_a_l_u_e_s
       if=	      input file name; standard	input is default
       of=	      output file name;	standard output	is default
       ibs=_n	      input block size _n bytes (default	512)
       obs=_n	      output block size	(default 512)
       bs=_n	      set both input and output	block  size,  superseding  _i_b_s
		      and _o_b_s_; also, if	no conversion is specified, it is par-
		      ticularly	efficient since	no copy	need be	done
       cbs=_n	      conversion buffer	size
       skip=_n	      skip _n input records before starting copy
       files=_n	      copy _n input files before	terminating (makes sense  only
		      where input is a magtape or similar device).
       seek=_n	      seek  _n  records	from  beginning	 of output file	before
		      copying
       count=_n	      copy only	_n input	records
       conv=ascii     convert EBCDIC to	ASCII
	    ebcdic    convert ASCII to EBCDIC
	    ibm	      slightly different map of	ASCII to EBCDIC
	    block     convert variable length records to fixed length
	    unblock   convert fixed length records to variable length
	    lcase     map alphabetics to lower case
	    ucase     map alphabetics to upper case
	    swab      swap every pair of bytes
	    noerror   do not stop processing on	an error
	    sync      pad every	input record to	_i_b_s
	    ...	, ... several comma-separated conversions

       Where sizes are specified, a number of bytes is expected.  A number may
       end with	kk,, bb or	ww to specify multiplication by 1024, 512, or 2 respec-
       tively; a pair of numbers may be	separated by xx to indicate a product.

       _C_b_s is used only	if _a_s_c_i_i_, _u_n_b_l_o_c_k_, _e_b_c_d_i_c_, _i_b_m_,	or _b_l_o_c_k conversion is
       specified.   In the first two cases, _c_b_s	characters are placed into the
       conversion buffer, any specified	character mapping  is  done,  trailing
       blanks  trimmed	and new-line added before sending the line to the out-
       put.  In	the latter three cases,	characters are read into  the  conver-
       sion buffer, and	blanks added to	make up	an output record of size _c_b_s.

       After  completion, _d_d reports the number	of whole and partial input and
       output blocks.

       For example, to read an EBCDIC tape blocked  ten	 80-byte  EBCDIC  card
       images per record into the ASCII	file _x_:

	      dd if=/dev/rmt0 of=x ibs=800 cbs=80 conv=ascii,lcase

       Note the	use of raw magtape.  _D_d	is especially suited to	I/O on the raw
       physical	devices	because	it allows reading  and	writing	 in  arbitrary
       record sizes.

       f+p records in(out): numbers of full and	partial	records	read(written)

BBUUGGSS
       The  ASCII/EBCDIC  conversion  tables  are taken	from the 256 character
       standard	in the CACM Nov,  1968.	  The  `ibm'  conversion,  while  less
       blessed	as  a  standard, corresponds better to certain IBM print train
       conventions.  There is no universal solution.
       One must	specify	``conv=noerror,sync'' when copying raw disks with  bad
       sectors to insure _d_d stays synchronized.

       Certain combinations of arguments to _c_o_n_v_= are permitted.  However, the
       _b_l_o_c_k or	_u_n_b_l_o_c_k	option cannot be combined with _a_s_c_i_i, _e_b_c_d_i_c  or  _i_b_m.
       Invalid	combinations  _s_i_l_e_n_t_l_y _i_g_n_o_r_e all but the last mutually-exclu-
       sive keyword.
