       hostname	- host name resolution description

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Hostnames  are domains, where a domain is a hierarchical, dot-separated
       list of subdomains; for example,	the machine  monet,  in	 the  Berkeley
       subdomain of the	EDU subdomain of the ARPANET would be represented as
		 monet.Berkeley.EDU
       (with no	trailing dot).

       Hostnames are often used	with network client and	server programs, which
       must generally translate	the name to an address for use.	  (This	 func-
       tion  is	 generally performed by	the library routine _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3).)
       Hostnames are resolved by the internet name resolver in	the  following
       fashion.

       If  the	name consists of a single component, i.e. contains no dot, and
       if the environment variable ``HOSTALIASES'' is set to  the  name	 of  a
       file,  that file	is searched for	an string matching the input hostname.
       The file	should consist of lines	made up	of two	white-space  separated
       strings,	 the  first  of	which is the hostname alias, and the second of
       which is	the complete hostname to be substituted	for that alias.	 If  a
       case-sensitive  match  is found between the hostname to be resolved and
       the first field of a line in the	file, the substituted name  is	looked
       up with no further processing.

       If  the	input  name  ends  with	 a  trailing  dot, the trailing	dot is
       removed,	and the	remaining name is looked up with no  further  process-
       ing.

       If  the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked up in
       the local domain	and its	parent domains until either a match  is	 found
       or fewer	than 2 components of the local domain remain.  For example, in
       the domain CS.Berkeley.EDU, the	name  lithium.CChem  will  be  checked
       first as	lithium.CChem.CS.Berkeley.EDU and then as lithium.CChem.Berke-
       ley.EDU.	 Lithium.CChem.EDU will	not be tried, as the there is only one
       component remaining from	the local domain.
