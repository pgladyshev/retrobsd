       An  array  of  strings  called  the  `environment' is made available by
       _e_x_e_c_v_e(2) when a	process	begins.	 By convention these strings have  the
       form `_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e'.  The following names are used	by various commands:

       PATH    The  sequence  of  directory  prefixes  that _s_h_,	_t_i_m_e_, _n_i_c_e(1),
	       etc., apply in searching	for a file known by an incomplete path
	       name.   The  prefixes  are  separated  by  `:'.	 _L_o_g_i_n(1) sets
	       PATH=:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin.

       HOME    A user's	login directory, set by	 _l_o_g_i_n(1)  from	 the  password
	       file _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       TERM    The  kind of terminal for which output is to be prepared.  This
	       information is used by commands,	such  as  _n_r_o_f_f	 or  _p_l_o_t(1G),
	       which   may   exploit   special	 terminal  capabilities.   See
	       _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p (_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)) for a list of terminal	types.

       SHELL   The file	name of	the users login	shell.

       TERMCAP The string describing the terminal in TERM, or the name of  the
	       termcap file, see _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5),_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(3X).

       EXINIT  A startup list of commands read by _e_x(1), _e_d_i_t(1), and _v_i(1).

       USER    The login name of the user.

       PRINTER The  name  of the default printer to be used by _l_p_r(1), _l_p_q(1),
	       and _l_p_r_m(1).

       Further names may be placed in the environment by  the  _e_x_p_o_r_t  command
       and  `name=value'  arguments  in	_s_h(1), or by the _s_e_t_e_n_v	command	if you
       use _c_s_h(1).  Arguments may also be placed in  the  environment  at  the
       point  of  an  _e_x_e_c_v_e(2).   It is unwise	to conflict with certain _s_h(1)
       variables that are frequently exported by `.profile' files: MAIL,  PS1,
       PS2, IFS.
