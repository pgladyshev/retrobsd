       This  file describes user id aliases used by _/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n_/_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l_.	 It is
       formatted as a series of	lines of the form
	    name: name_1, name2, name_3, . . .
       The _n_a_m_e	is the name to alias, and the _n_a_m_e___n are the aliases for  that
       name.   Lines beginning with white space	are continuation lines.	 Lines
       beginning with `#' are comments.

       Aliasing	occurs only on local names.  Loops can	not  occur,  since  no
       message will be sent to any person more than once.

       After  aliasing	has  been  done, local and valid recipients who	have a
       ``.forward'' file in their home directory have  messages	 forwarded  to
       the list	of users defined in that file.

       This  is	 only  the  raw	 data file; the	actual aliasing	information is
       placed  into  a	binary	format	in  the	 files	_/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s_._d_i_r   and
       _/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s_._p_a_g	using the program _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s_e_s(1).  A _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s_e_s command
       should be executed each time the	aliases	file is	changed	for the	change
       to take effect.

       Because	of  restrictions in _d_b_m(3X) a single alias cannot contain more
       than about 1000 bytes of	information.  You can get  longer  aliases  by
       ``chaining'';  that is, make the	last name in the alias be a dummy name
       which is	a continuation alias.
