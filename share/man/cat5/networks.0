       The  _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s  file  contains  information regarding the	known networks
       which comprise the DARPA	Internet.  For	each  network  a  single  line
       should be present with the following information:

       official	network	name
       network number
       aliases

       Items  are  separated by	any number of blanks and/or tab	characters.  A
       ``#'' indicates the beginning of	a comment; characters up to the	end of
       the  line  are not interpreted by routines which	search the file.  This
       file is normally	created	from the official network data base maintained
       at  the	Network	Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes
       may be required to bring	it up to  date	regarding  unofficial  aliases
       and/or unknown networks.

       Network	number	may  be	 specified  in the conventional	``.'' notation
       using the _i_n_e_t___n_e_t_w_o_r_k()	routine	from the Internet address manipulation
       library,	 _i_n_e_t(3N).   Network names may contain any printable character
       other than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
