       _G_r_o_u_p contains for each group the following information:

       group name
       encrypted password
       numerical group ID
       a comma separated list of all users allowed in the group

       This  is	an ASCII file.	The fields are separated by colons; Each group
       is separated from the next by a new-line.  If  the  password  field  is
       null, no	password is demanded.

       This  file  resides  in directory /etc.	Because	of the encrypted pass-
       words, it can and does have general read	permission and	can  be	 used,
       for example, to map numerical group ID's	to names.
