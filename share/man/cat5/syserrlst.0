       syserrlst - error message file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _m_k_e_r_r_l_s_t(1), creates error message files	in the format described	below.

       An  ``error message file'' consists of a	header,	an array of structures
       specifying the offset and length	of each	message, and the array of mes-
       sage strings separated by newlines.

       The  message  strings are separated by newlines but the newline charac-
       ters are	nnoott included in	the size of the	message.  These	newline	 char-
       acters  serve only to make the file editable or printable (after	strip-
       ping off	the header).

       The file	format is:

       /*
	* Definitions used by the 'mkerrlst' program which creates error message
	* files.
	*
	* The format of	the file created is:
	*
	*   struct    ERRLSTHDR	ehdr;
	*   struct    ERRLST  emsg[num_of_messages];
	*   struct    {
	*	 char msg[] = "error message string";
	*	 char lf = '0;
	*	 } [num_of_messages];
	*
	* Note:	 the newlines are NOT included in the message lengths, the newlines
	*	 are present to	make it	easy to	'cat' or 'vi' the file.
       */
