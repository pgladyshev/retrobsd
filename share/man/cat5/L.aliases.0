       L.aliases - UUCP	hostname alias file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _L_._a_l_i_a_s_e_s file defines mapping (aliasing) of	system names for uucp.
       This is intended	for compensating for systems that have changed	names,
       or do not provide their entire machine name (like most USG systems). It
       is also useful when a machine's name is not obvious  or	commonly  mis-
       spelled.

       Each line in _L_._a_l_i_a_s_e_s is of the	form:

	    real_name alias_name

       Any  amount  of whitespace may separate the two items.  Lines beginning
       with a `#' character are	comments.

       All occurrences of _a_l_i_a_s___n_a_m_e are mapped	 to  _r_e_a_l___n_a_m_e	by  _u_u_c_i_c_o(8),
       _u_u_c_p(1),	and _u_u_x(1).  The mapping occurs	regardless of whether the name
       was typed in by a user or provided by a remote site.  An	 exception  is
       the  --ss	option	of  _u_u_c_i_c_o; only the site's real hostname (the name in
       _L_._s_y_s(5)) will be accepted there.

       Aliased system names should not be placed in _L_._s_y_s; they	 will  not  be
       used.
