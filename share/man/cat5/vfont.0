       The  fonts  for	the  printer/plotters have the following format.  Each
       file contains a header, an array	of 256	character  description	struc-
       tures, and then the bit maps for	the characters themselves.  The	header
       has the following format:

	    struct header {
		    short	    magic;
		    unsigned short  size;
		    short	    maxx;
		    short	    maxy;
		    short	    xtnd;
	    } header;

       The _m_a_g_i_c number	is 0436	(octal).  The _m_a_x_x_, _m_a_x_y_, and _x_t_n_d fields  are
       not  used  at  the  current time.  _M_a_x_x and _m_a_x_y	are intended to	be the
       maximum horizontal and vertical size of	any  glyph  in	the  font,  in
       raster  lines.  The _s_i_z_e	is the size of the bit maps for	the characters
       in bytes.  Before the maps for the characters is	an array of 256	struc-
       tures for each of the possible characters in the	font.  Each element of
       the array has the form:

	    struct dispatch {
		    unsigned short  addr;
		    short	    nbytes;
		    char	    up;
		    char	    down;
		    char	    left;
		    char	    right;
		    short	    width;
	    };

       The _n_b_y_t_e_s field	is nonzero for characters which	actually  exist.   For
       such  characters, the _a_d_d_r field	is an offset into the rest of the file
       where the data for that character begins.  There	are  _u_p_+_d_o_w_n  rows  of
       data  for each character, each of which has _l_e_f_t_+_r_i_g_h_t bits, rounded up
       to a number of bytes.  The _w_i_d_t_h	field is not used by vcat, although it
       is  to make width tables	for _t_r_o_f_f.  It represents the logical width of
       the glyph, in raster lines, and shows where the base point of the  next
       glyph would be.
