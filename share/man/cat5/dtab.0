       dtab - automatic	system configuration device table (2BSD)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _d_t_a_b  file	contains  a list of the	devices	that the _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f_i_g(8)
       program will attempt to attach to the system.

       Each line describes one device which may	 be  present  on  the  system;
       additional devices of the same type require additional lines.  The line
       contains	at least six fields separated by white space.  Blank lines and
       comments	 can  appear  anywhere in the file except between fields; com-
       ments are delimited by `#' and new line.	 The fields are	(in order):

       dev	   The device name, usually two	characters

       unit	   Either a unit number	or a `?' indicating  automatic	selec-
		   tion	of unit	numbers.

       addr	   The	address	 of  the  device's first register, as a	16-bit
		   octal number.

       vector	   The interrupt vector, in octal.

       BR	   The priority	at which the device interrupts.

       handler(s)  One or more routine names with which	the  interrupt	vector
		   is filled.
