       The  _s_h_e_l_l_s file	contains a list	of the shells on the system.  For each
       shell a single line should be present, consisting of the	shell's	 path,
       relative	to root.

       A  hash	mark  (``#'') indicates	the beginning of a comment; subsequent
       characters up to	the end	of the line are	not interpreted	 by  the  rou-
       tines which search the file.  Blank lines are also ignored.
