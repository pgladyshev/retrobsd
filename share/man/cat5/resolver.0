       The  resolver  configuration  file contains information that is read by
       the resolver routines the first time they are  invoked  by  a  process.
       The  file is designed to	be human readable and contains a list of name-
       value pairs that	provide	various	types of resolver information.

       On a normally configured	system this file should	not be necessary.  The
       only  name  server  to  be queried will be on the local machine and the
       domain name is retrieved	from the system.

       The different configuration options are:

       nnaammeesseerrvveerr
	      followed by the Internet address (in dot	notation)  of  a  name
	      server that the resolver should query.  At least one name	server
	      should be	listed.	 Up to MAXNS (currently	3) name	servers	may be
	      listed,  in that case the	resolver library queries tries them in
	      the order	listed.	 If no nnaammeesseerrvveerr  entries  are	 present,  the
	      default  is  to  use the name server on the local	machine.  (The
	      algorithm	used is	to try a name server, and if the  query	 times
	      out, try the next, until out of name servers, then repeat	trying
	      all the name servers until  a  maximum  number  of  retries  are
	      made).

       ddoommaaiinn followed	by a domain name, that is the default domain to	append
	      to names that do not have	a dot in them.	If no  ddoommaaiinn  entries
	      are  present,  the  domain  returned  by	_g_e_t_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(2) is used
	      (everything after	the first `.').	 Finally,  if  the  host  name
	      does not contain a domain	part, the root domain is assumed.

       The name	value pair must	appear on a single line, and the keyword (e.g.
       nnaammeesseerrvveerr) must	start the line.	 The value follows the keyword,	 sepa-
       rated by	white space.
