       _V_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s  contains all language	definitions for	vgrind.	 The data base
       is very similar to _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5).

       The following table names and describes each field.

       The following entry, which describes the	C language, is	typical	 of  a
       language	entry.

       C|c:   :pb=^\d?*?\d?\p\d?a?:bb={:be=}:cb=/*:ce=*/:sb=":se=\e":\
	      :lb=':le=\e':tl:\
	      :kw=asm auto break case char continue default do double else enum\
	      extern float for fortran goto if int long	register return	short\
	      sizeof static struct switch typedef union	unsigned while #define\
	      #else #endif #if #ifdef #ifndef #include #undef #	define else endif\
	      if ifdef ifndef include undef:

       Note  that  the first field is just the language	name (and any variants
       of it).	Thus the C language could be specified to _v_g_r_i_n_d(1) as "c"  or
       "C".

       Entries	may  continue  onto  multiple  lines by	giving a \ as the last
       character of a line.  Capabilities in _v_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s are of two types: Bool-
       ean  capabilities  which	indicate that the language has some particular
       feature and string capabilities which give a regular expression or key-
       word list.

       _V_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s  uses	regular	 expression which are very similar to those of
       _e_x(1) and _l_e_x(1).  The characters `^', `$', `:' and  `\'	 are  reserved
       characters  and	must  be "quoted" with a preceding \ if	they are to be
       included	as normal characters.  The metasymbols and their meanings are:

       $      the end of a line

       ^      the beginning of a line

       \d     a	delimiter (space, tab, newline,	start of line)

       \a     matches any string of symbols (like .* in	lex)

       \p     matches any alphanumeric name.  In a procedure  definition  (pb)
	      the  string  that	 matches  this symbol is used as the procedure
	      name.

       ()     grouping

       |      alternation

       ?      last item	is optional

       \e     preceding	any string means that the string  will	not  match  an
	      input  string if the input string	is preceded by an escape char-
	      acter (\).  This is typically used for languages (like C)	 which
	      can include the string delimiter in a string b escaping it.

       Unlike  other regular expressions in the	system,	 these match words and
       not characters.	Hence something	 like  "(tramp|steamer)flies?"	 would
       match "tramp", "steamer", "trampflies", or "steamerflies".

       KKEEYYWWOORRDD LLIISSTT

       The  keyword  list is just a list of keywords in	the language separated
       by spaces.  If the "oc" boolean is specified, indicating	that upper and
       lower case are equivalent, then all the keywords	should be specified in
       lower case.
