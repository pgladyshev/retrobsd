       _P_r_i_n_t_c_a_p	 is  a	simplified version of the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data base used to
       describe	line printers.	The spooling system accesses the _p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p file
       every time it is	used, allowing dynamic addition	and deletion of	print-
       ers.  Each entry	in the data base is  used  to  describe	 one  printer.
       This  data base may not be substituted for, as is possible for _t_e_r_m_c_a_p,
       because it may allow accounting to be bypassed.

       The default printer is normally _l_p,  though  the	 environment  variable
       PRINTER	may  be	used to	override this.	Each spooling utility supports
       an option,  --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_,  to  allow  explicit  naming  of	a  destination
       printer.

       sion on how setup the database for a given printer.

       If the local line printer driver	supports indentation, the daemon  must
       understand how to invoke	it.

FFIILLTTEERRSS
       The  _l_p_d(8)  daemon  creates a pipeline of _f_i_l_t_e_r_s to process files for
       various printer types.  The filters selected depend on the flags	passed
       to _l_p_r(1).  The pipeline	set up is:

	      -p   pr |	if   regular text + _p_r(1)
	      none if	     regular text
	      -c   cf	     cifplot
	      -d   df	     DVI (tex)
	      -g   gf	     _p_l_o_t(3)
	      -n   nf	     ditroff
	      -f   rf	     Fortran
	      -t   tf	     troff
	      -v   vf	     raster image

       The iiff filter is	invoked	with arguments:

	    _i_f [ --cc ] --wwwidth --lllength --iiindent	--nn login --hh host acct-file

       The --cc flag is passed only if the --ll flag (pass control characters lit-
       erally) is specified to _l_p_r.  _W_i_d_t_h and _l_e_n_g_t_h specify the  page	 width
       and  length (from ppww and	ppll respectively) in characters.	 The --nn	and --hh
       parameters specify the login name and host name of the owner of the job
       respectively.  _A_c_c_t_-_f_i_l_e	is passed from the aaff _p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p entry.

       If no iiff	is specified, ooff is used instead, with the distinction that ooff
       is opened only once, while iiff  is  opened  for  every  individual  job.
       Thus,  iiff  is  better  suited to	performing accounting.	The ooff is only
       given the _w_i_d_t_h and _l_e_n_g_t_h flags.

       All other filters are called as:

	    _f_i_l_t_e_r --xxwidth --yylength --nn login --hh	host acct-file

       where _w_i_d_t_h and _l_e_n_g_t_h are represented in pixels, specified by  the  ppxx
       and ppyy entries respectively.

       All  filters  take  _s_t_d_i_n  as  the file,	_s_t_d_o_u_t as the printer, may log
       either to _s_t_d_e_r_r	or using _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), and	must not ignore	SIGINT.

LLOOGGGGIINNGG
       Error messages generated	by the line printer programs themselves	 (that
       is,  the	 _l_p* programs) are logged by _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) using the _L_P_R facility.
       Messages	printed	on _s_t_d_e_r_r of one of the	filters	are sent to the	corre-
       sponding	llff file.  The filters may, of course, use _s_y_s_l_o_g themselves.

       Error  messages	sent  to the console have a carriage return and	a line
       feed appended to	them, rather than just a line feed.
