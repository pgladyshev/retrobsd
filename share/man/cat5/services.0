       The  _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s  file  contains  information regarding the	known services
       available in the	DARPA Internet.	 For each service a single line	should
       be present with the following information:

       official	service	name
       port number
       protocol	name
       aliases

       Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  The
       port number and protocol	name are considered a single _i_t_e_m; a ``/''  is
       used  to	 separate  the	port and protocol (e.g.	``512/tcp'').  A ``#''
       indicates the beginning of a comment; characters	up to the end  of  the
       line are	not interpreted	by routines which search the file.

       Service	names  may  contain any	printable character other than a field
       delimiter, newline, or comment character.
