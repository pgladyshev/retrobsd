       The  archive  table-of-contents	command	_r_a_n_l_i_b creates a table of con-
       tents for archives, containing object files, to be used	by  the	 link-
       editor _l_d(1)_.  It operates on archives created with the utility _a_r(1)_.

       The  _R_a_n_l_i_b  function  prepends a new file to the archive which has two
       separate	parts.	The first part is a standard archive header, which has
       a special name field,  "__.SYMDEF".

       The  second part	is a list of ranlib structures of variable size.  Each
       of the ranlib structures	consists of a sequence of records,  terminated
       by 1, 2,	3 or 4 zero bytes (to align to word boundary).

       Every  record consists of a byte	with name length, a word specifying an
       offset from the beginning of the	archive	to the start  of  the  archive
       file which defines the symbol, and a symbol name	of given length.
