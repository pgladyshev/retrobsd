       hosts - host name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _h_o_s_t_s  file	 contains information regarding	the known hosts	on the
       network.	 For each host a single	line should be present with  the  fol-
       lowing information:

       official	host name
       Internet	address
       aliases

       Items  are  separated by	any number of blanks and/or tab	characters.  A
       ``#'' indicates the beginning of	a comment; characters up to the	end of
       the line	are not	interpreted by routines	which search the file.

       When  using  the	name server _n_a_m_e_d(8), this file	provides a backup when
       the name	server is not running.	For the	name server, it	 is  suggested
       that  only  a  few  addresses  be included in this file.	 These include
       address for the local interfaces	that _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g(8C) needs	at  boot  time
       and a few machines on the local network.

       This file may be	created	from the official host data base maintained at
       the Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes  may
       be  required to bring it	up to date regarding unofficial	aliases	and/or
       unknown hosts.  As the data base	maintained at NIC is  incomplete,  use
       of the name server is recommend for sites on the	DARPA Internet.

       Network	addresses  are	specified  in  the conventional	``.'' notation
       using the _i_n_e_t___a_d_d_r() routine from the  Internet	 address  manipulation
       library,	 _i_n_e_t(3N).   Host  names  may  contain any printable character
       other than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
