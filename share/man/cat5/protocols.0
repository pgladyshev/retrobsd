       The  _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s  file contains information regarding the known protocols
       used in the DARPA Internet.  For	each protocol a	single line should  be
       present with the	following information:

       official	protocol name
       protocol	number
       aliases

       Items  are  separated by	any number of blanks and/or tab	characters.  A
       ``#'' indicates the beginning of	a comment; characters up to the	end of
       the line	are not	interpreted by routines	which search the file.

       Protocol	 names	may contain any	printable character other than a field
       delimiter, newline, or comment character.
