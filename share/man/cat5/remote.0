       remote -	remote host description	file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  systems  known  by	_t_i_p(1C)	 and their attributes are stored in an
       ASCII file which	is structured somewhat like the	_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) file.  Each
       line  in	 the  file provides a description for a	single _s_y_s_t_e_m.	Fields
       are separated by	a colon	(``:'').  Lines	ending in a \  character  with
       an immediately following	newline	are continued on the next line.

       The  first  entry  is the name(s) of the	host system.  If there is more
       than one	name for a system, the names are separated by  vertical	 bars.
       After  the  name	 of the	system comes the fields	of the description.  A
       field name followed by an `=' sign indicates a string value follows.  A
       field name followed by a	`#' sign indicates a following numeric value.

       Entries	named ``tip*'' and ``cu*'' are used as default entries by _t_i_p,
       and the _c_u interface to _t_i_p, as follows.	 When _t_i_p is invoked with only
       a phone number, it looks	for an entry of	the form ``tip300'', where 300
       is the baud rate	with which the connection is to	be made.  When the  _c_u
       interface is used, entries of the form ``cu300''	are used.

CCAAPPAABBIILLIITTIIEESS
       Capabilities  are either	strings	(str), numbers (num), or boolean flags
       (bool).	A string capability is	specified  by  _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y=_v_a_l_u_e;  e.g.
       ``dv=/dev/harris''.   A	numeric	 capability  is	 specified by _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_-
       _i_t_y#_v_a_l_u_e; e.g. ``xa#99''.  A boolean capability	is specified by	simply
       listing the capability.

       aatt   (str) Auto call unit type.

       bbrr   (num)  The	baud  rate  used  in  establishing a connection	to the
	    remote host.  This is a decimal number.  The default baud rate  is
	    300	baud.

       ccmm   (str) An initial connection	message	to be sent to the remote host.
	    For	example, if a host is  reached	through	 port  selector,  this
	    might be set to the	appropriate sequence required to switch	to the
	    host.

       ccuu   (str) Call unit if making a	phone call.  Default is	 the  same  as
	    the	`dv' field.

       ddii   (str)  Disconnect  message	sent  to the host when a disconnect is
	    requested by the user.

       dduu   (bool) This	host is	on a dial-up line.

       ddvv   (str) UNIX device(s) to open to establish a	connection.   If  this
	    file  refers  to  a	 terminal line,	_t_i_p(1C)	attempts to perform an
	    exclusive open on the device to insure only	one user at a time has
	    access to the port.

       eell   (str)  Characters  marking	an  end-of-line.  The default is NULL.
	    `~'	escapes	are only recognized by _t_i_p after one of	the characters
	    in `el', or	after a	carriage-return.

       ffss   (str)  Frame  size for transfers.  The default frame size is equal
	    to BUFSIZ.

       hhdd   (bool) The host uses half-duplex communication, local echo	should
	    be performed.

       iiee   (str) Input	end-of-file marks.  The	default	is NULL.

       ooee   (str)  Output  end-of-file string.	The default is NULL.  When _t_i_p
	    is transferring a file, this string	is sent	at end-of-file.

       ppaa   (str) The type of parity to	use when sending  data	to  the	 host.
	    This  may  be one of ``even'', ``odd'', ``none'', ``zero'' (always
	    set	bit 8 to zero),	``one''	(always	set bit	8 to 1).  The  default
	    is even parity.

       ppnn   (str)  Telephone number(s) for this	host.  If the telephone	number
	    field contains an @	sign, _t_i_p searches the file  _/_e_t_c_/_p_h_o_n_e_s  file
	    for	a list of telephone numbers; c.f.  _p_h_o_n_e_s(5).

       ttcc   (str)  Indicates that the list of capabilities is continued	in the
	    named description.	This is	used primarily to share	 common	 capa-
	    bility information.

       Here  is	a short	example	showing	the use	of the capability continuation
       feature:
