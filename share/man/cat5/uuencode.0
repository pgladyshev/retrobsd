       Files  output  by  _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e_(_1_C_) consist of a header line, followed by a
       number of body lines, and a trailer line.  _U_u_d_e_c_o_d_e_(_1_C_) will ignore any
       lines preceding the header or following the trailer.  Lines preceding a
       header must not,	of course, look	like a header.

       The header line is distinguished	 by  having  the  first	 6  characters
       "begin ".   The	word  _b_e_g_i_n  is	 followed  by a	mode (in octal), and a
       string which names the remote file.  A space separates the three	 items
       in the header line.

       The body	consists of a number of	lines, each at most 62 characters long
       (including the trailing newline).  These	consist	of a character	count,
       followed	 by  encoded characters, followed by a newline.	 The character
       count is	a single printing character, and represents  an	 integer,  the
       number  of  bytes  the  rest of the line	represents.  Such integers are
       always in the range from	0 to 63	and can	be determined  by  subtracting
       the character space (octal 40) from the character.

       Groups  of  3  bytes  are stored	in 4 characters, 6 bits	per character.
       All are offset by a space to make the characters	 printing.   The  last
       line  may  be  shorter  than the	normal 45 bytes.  If the size is not a
       multiple	of 3, this fact	can be determined by the value of the count on
       the  last  line.	  Extra	garbage	will be	included to make the character
       count a multiple	of 4.  The body	is terminated by a line	with  a	 count
       of zero.	 This line consists of one ASCII space.

       The trailer line	consists of "end" on a line by itself.
