       L-devices - UUCP	device description file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  L-devices file is consulted	by the UUCP daemon _u_u_c_i_c_o(8) under the
       direction of _L_._s_y_s(5) for information on	the devices that it  may  use.
       Each line describes exactly one device.

       A line in _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s has the form:

       Caller  Device  Call_Unit  Class	 Dialer	 [Expect  Send]....

       Each  item  can	be  separated  by  any number of blanks	or tabs. Lines
       beginning with a	`#' character are comments; long lines can be  contin-
       ued by appending	a `\' character	to the end of the line.

       _C_a_l_l_e_r  denotes	the type of connection,	and must be one	of the follow-
       ing:

       AACCUU     Automatic call unit, e.g., autodialing modems such as the Hayes
	       Smartmodem 1200 or Novation ``Smart Cat''.

       DDIIRR     Direct  connect;	 hardwired  line  (usually RS-232) to a	remote
	       system.

       DDKK      AT&T Datakit.

       MMIICCOOMM   Micom Terminal switch.

       PPAADD     X.25 PAD	connection.

       PPCCPP     GTE Telenet PC Pursuit.

       SSYYTTEEKK   Sytek high-speed	dedicated modem	port connection.

       TTCCPP     Berkeley	TCP/IP or 3Com UNET  connection.  These	 are  mutually
	       exclusive.   Note  that listing TCP connections in _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s is
	       superfluous; _u_u_c_i_c_o does	not even bother	to look	here since  it
	       has all the information it needs	in _L_._s_y_s(5).

       _D_e_v_i_c_e  is a device file	in /dev/ that is opened	to use the device. The
       device file must	be owned by UUCP, with access modes of 0600 or better.
       (See _c_h_m_o_d(2)).

       _C_a_l_l___U_n_i_t  is an	optional second	device file name.  True	automatic call
       units use a separate device file	for data and for dialing;  the	_D_e_v_i_c_e
       field  specifies	the data port, while the _C_a_l_l___u_n_i_t field specifies the
       dialing port.  If the _C_a_l_l___u_n_i_t field is	unused,	it must	 not  be  left
       empty.	Insert	a  dummy  entry	 as  a	placeholder,  such as ``0'' or
       ``unused.''

       _C_l_a_s_s is	an integer number that specifies the line  baud	 (for  dialers
       and direct lines) or the	port number (for network connections).

       The  _C_l_a_s_s may be preceded by a non-numeric prefix.  This is to differ-
       entiate among devices that have identical _C_a_l_l_e_r	and baud, but are dis-
       tinctly	different.   For  example,  ``1200''  could  refer to all Bell
       212-compatible modems, ``V1200''	to Racal-Vadic modems,	and  ``C1200''
       to  CCITT  modems, all at 1200 baud.  Similarly,	``W1200'' could	denote
       long distance lines, while ``L1200'' could refer	to local phone lines.

       _D_i_a_l_e_r applies only to ACU devices. This	is the "brand" or type of  the
       ACU or modem.

       DDFF0022    DEC DF02	or DF03	modems.

       DDFF111122   Dec  DF112  modems.  Use	 a  _D_i_a_l_e_r field of DDFF111122TT to use tone
	       dialing,	or DDFF111122PP for pulse dialing.

       aatttt     AT&T 2224 2400 baud modem.

       ccddss222244  Concord Data Systems 224	2400 baud modem.

       ddnn1111    DEC DN11	Unibus dialer.

       hhaayyeess   Hayes Smartmodem	1200 and compatible autodialing	modems.	 Use a
	       _D_i_a_l_e_r  field  of  hhaayyeessttoonnee to use tone	dialing, or hhaayyeessppuullssee
	       for pulse dialing.  It is also permissible to include the  let-
	       ters  `T'  and  `P' in the phone	number (in _L_._s_y_s) to change to
	       tone or pulse midway through dialing.  (Note that a leading `T'
	       or `P' will be interpreted as a dialcode!)

       hhaayyeess22440000
	       Hayes  Smartmodem  2400	and  compatible	 modems.  Use a	_D_i_a_l_e_r
	       field of	hhaayyeess22440000ttoonnee to use tone dialing,  or	hhaayyeess22440000ppuullssee
	       for pulse dialing.

       nnoovvaattiioonn
	       Novation	``Smart	Cat'' autodialing modem.

       ppeennrriill  Penril  Corp ``Hayes compatible'' modems	(they really aren't or
	       they would use the hhaayyeess	entry.)

       rrvvmmaaccss  Racal-Vadic 820 dialer with 831 adapter in  a  MACS  configura-
	       tion.

       vvaa221122   Racal-Vadic 212 autodialing modem.

       vvaa882200   Racal-Vadic 820 dialer with 831 adapter.

       vvaaddiicc   Racal-Vadic 3450	and 3451 series	autodialing modems.

       vveenntteell  Ventel 212+ autodialing modem.

       vvmmaaccss   Racal-Vadic  811	 dialer	 with 831 adapter in a MACS configura-
	       tion.

       _E_x_p_e_c_t_/_S_e_n_d is an optional _E_x_p_e_c_t_/_S_e_n_d script  for  getting  through  a
       smart port selector, or for issuing special commands to the modem.  The
       syntax is identical to that of the Expect/Send script  of  _L_._s_y_s.   The
       difference  is  that the	_L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s script is used _b_e_f_o_r_e	the connection
       is made,	while the _L_._s_y_s	script is used _a_f_t_e_r.
