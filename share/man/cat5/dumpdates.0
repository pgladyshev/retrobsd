       Tapes used by _d_u_m_p and _r_e_s_t_o_r(8)	contain:

	      a	header record
	      two groups of bit	map records
	      a	group of records describing directories
	      a	group of records describing files

       description as given in the include file	_<_d_u_m_p_r_e_s_t_o_r_._h_> is:

       _N_T_R_E_C is	the number of BSIZE (sys/param.h) byte records in  a  physical
       tape block.  _M_L_E_N is the	number of bits in a bit	map word.  _M_S_I_Z	is the
       number of bit map words.

       The _T_S__ entries are used	in the _c___t_y_p_e field to indicate	what  sort  of
       header this is.	The types and their meanings are as follows:

       TS_TAPE Tape volume label
       TS_INODE
	       A  file	or directory follows.  The _c___d_i_n_o_d_e field is a copy of
	       the disk	inode and contains bits	telling	what sort of file this
	       is.
       TS_BITS A  bit  map follows.  This bit map has a	one bit	for each inode
	       that was	dumped.
       TS_ADDR A subrecord of a	file description.  See _c___a_d_d_r below.
       TS_END  End of tape record.
       TS_CLRI A bit map follows.  This	bit map	contains a zero	 bit  for  all
	       inodes that were	empty on the file system when dumped.
       MAGIC   All header records have this number in _c___m_a_g_i_c_.
       CHECKSUM
	       Header records checksum to this value.

       The fields of the header	structure are as follows:

       c_type	The type of the	header.
       c_date	The date the dump was taken.
       c_ddate	The date the file system was dumped from.
       c_volume	The current volume number of the dump.
       c_tapea	The current number of this (512-byte) record.
       c_inumber
		The  number  of	 the  inode  being  dumped  if this is of type
		_T_S___I_N_O_D_E_.
       c_magic	This contains the value	_M_A_G_I_C above, truncated as needed.
       c_checksum
		This contains whatever value is	needed to make the record  sum
		to _C_H_E_C_K_S_U_M_.
       c_dinode	This  is a copy	of the inode as	it appears on the file system;
		see _f_i_l_s_y_s(5).
       c_count	The count of characters	in _c___a_d_d_r_.
       c_addr	An array of characters describing the  blocks  of  the	dumped
		file.	A  character is	zero if	the block associated with that
		character was not present on the file  system,	otherwise  the
		character  is  non-zero.   If the block	was not	present	on the
		file system, no	block was dumped; the block will  be  restored
		as  a  hole  in	the file.  If there is not sufficient space in
		this record to describe	all of the blocks in a	file,  _T_S___A_D_D_R
		records	 will  be scattered through the	file, each one picking
		up where the last left off.

       Each volume except the last ends	with a tapemark	(read  as  an  end  of
       file).	The  last  volume ends with a _T_S___E_N_D record and	then the tape-
       mark.

       The structure _i_d_a_t_e_s describes an entry of the  file  _/_e_t_c_/_d_d_a_t_e	 where
       dump history is kept.  The fields of the	structure are:

       id_name	The dumped file	system is `/dev/_i_d___n_a_m_'_.
       id_incno	The level number of the	dump tape; see _d_u_m_p(8).
       id_ddate	The  date  of  the  incremental	 dump  in  system  format  see
		_t_y_p_e_s(5).
