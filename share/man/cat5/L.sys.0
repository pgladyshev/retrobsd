       L.sys - UUCP remote host	description file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _L_._s_y_s  file	is consulted by	the UUCP daemon	_u_u_c_i_c_o(8) for informa-
       tion on remote systems.	_L_._s_y_s includes the  system  name,  appropriate
       times  to  call,	phone numbers, and a login and password	for the	remote
       system.	_L_._s_y_s is thus a	privileged file, owned by the UUCP Administra-
       tor; it is accessible only to the Administrator and to the superuser.

       Each line in _L_._s_y_s describes one	connection to one remote host, and has
       the form:

       System  Times  Caller  Class  Device/Phone_Number  [Expect  Send]....

       Fields can be separated by any number of	blanks or tabs.	 Lines	begin-
       ning  with a `#'	character are comments;	long lines can be continued by
       appending a `\' character to the	end of the line.

       The first five fields (_S_y_s_t_e_m through _D_e_v_i_c_e_/_P_h_o_n_e___N_u_m_b_e_r) specify  the
       hardware	 mechanism  that is necessary to make a	connection to a	remote
       host, such as a modem or	network.  _U_u_c_i_c_o searches from	the  top  down
       through	_L_._s_y_s  to  find	 the  desired  _S_y_s_t_e_m;	it  then  opens	the _L_-
       _d_e_v_i_c_e_s(5) file and searches for	the first available  device  with  the
       same  _C_a_l_l_e_r,  _C_l_a_s_s, and (possibly) _D_e_v_i_c_e.  (``Available'' means that
       the device is ready and not being used  for  something  else.)	_U_u_c_i_c_o
       attempts	 a  connection	using that device; if the connection cannot be
       made (for example, a dialer gets	a busy signal),	_u_u_c_i_c_o tries the  next
       available  device.  If this also	fails, it returns to _L_._s_y_s to look for
       another line for	the same _S_y_s_t_e_m.  If none is found, _u_u_c_i_c_o gives up.

       _S_y_s_t_e_m is the hostname of the remote system.  Every machine with	 which
       this  system  communicates via UUCP should be listed, regardless	of who
       calls whom.  Systems not	listed in _L_._s_y_s	will not be permitted  a  con-
       nection.	  The  local hostname should nnoott appear	here for security rea-
       sons.

       _T_i_m_e_s is	a comma-separated list of the times of the day and  week  that
       calls  are  permitted  to  this _S_y_s_t_e_m.	_T_i_m_e_s is most commonly used to
       restrict	long distance telephone	calls to those times  when  rates  are
       lower.  List items are constructed as:

	    _k_e_y_w_o_r_dhhmm--hhmm//_g_r_a_d_e;;_r_e_t_r_y___t_i_m_e

       _K_e_y_w_o_r_d is required, and	must be	one of:

       AAnnyy     Any time, any day of the	week.

       WWkk      Any weekday. In addition, MMoo, TTuu, WWee, TThh, FFrr, SSaa, and SSuu	can be
	       used for	Monday through Sunday, respectively.

       EEvveenniinngg When evening telephone rates are	in effect, from	1700  to  0800
	       Monday  through	Friday,	 and  all  day	Saturday  and  Sunday.
	       EEvveenniinngg is the same as WWkk11770000--00880000,,SSaa,,SSuu.

       NNiigghhtt   When nighttime telephone	rates are in effect, from 2300 to 0800
	       Monday  through Friday, all day Saturday, and from 2300 to 1700
	       Sunday.	NNiigghhtt is the same as AAnnyy22330000--00880000,,SSaa,,SSuu00880000--11770000.

       NNoonnPPeeaakk This is a slight	modification of	EEvveenniinngg.  It matches when  the
	       USA X.25	carriers have their lower rate period. This is 1800 to
	       0700 Monday through Friday, and all day	Saturday  and  Sunday.
	       NNoonnPPeeaakk is the same as AAnnyy11880000--00770000,,SSaa,,SSuu.

       NNeevveerr   Never  call;  calling into this _S_y_s_t_e_m is forbidden or impossi-
	       ble.  This is intended for polled connections, where the	remote
	       system calls into the local machine periodically.  This is nec-
	       essary when one of the machines is lacking  either  dial-in  or
	       dial-out	modems.

       The optional _h_h_m_m_-_h_h_m_m subfield provides	a time range that modifies the
       keyword.	 _h_h_m_m refers to	_h_o_u_r_s and _m_i_n_u_t_e_s in 24-hour time  (from  0000
       to  2359).   The	time range is permitted	to "wrap" around midnight, and
       will behave in the obvious way. It is invalid to	 follow	 the  EEvveenniinngg,
       NNoonnPPeeaakk,	and NNiigghhtt keywords with	a time range.

       The  _g_r_a_d_e  subfield  is	 optional; if present, it is composed of a `/'
       (slash) and single character denoting the _g_r_a_d_e of the connection, from
       00  to 99,	AA to ZZ,	or aa to	zz.  This specifies that	only requests of grade
       _g_r_a_d_e or	better will be transferred during this time.  (The grade of  a
       request or job is specified when	it is queued by	_u_u_c_p or	_u_u_x.)  By con-
       vention,	mail is	sent at	grade CC, news is sent at  grade	 dd,  and  uucp
       copies  are  sent  at grade nn.  Unfortunately, some sites do not	follow
       these conventions, so it	is not 100% reliable.

       The _r_e_t_r_y___t_i_m_e subfield is optional; it	must  be  preceded  by	a  `;'
       (semicolon) and specifies the time, in minutes, before a	failed connec-
       tion may	be tried again.	 (This restriction is in addition to any  con-
       straints	imposed	by the rest of the _T_i_m_e	field.)	 By default, the retry
       time starts at 10 minutes and  gradually	 increases  at	each  failure,
       until  after  26	tries _u_u_c_i_c_o gives up completely (MAX RETRIES).	If the
       retry time is too small,	_u_u_c_i_c_o may run into MAX	RETRIES	too soon.

       _C_a_l_l_e_r is the type of device used:

       AACCUU     Automatic call unit or auto-dialing modem  such	as  the	 Hayes
	       Smartmodem  1200	or Novation ``Smart Cat''. See _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s for a
	       list of supported modems.

       DDIIRR     Direct connect; hardwired line (usually	RS-232)	 to  a	remote
	       system.

       MMIICCOOMM   Micom Terminal Switch.

       PPAADD     X.25 PAD	connection.

       PPCCPP     GTE   Telenet  PC  Pursuit.  See	 _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s  for	 configuration
	       details.

       SSYYTTEEKK   Sytek high-speed	dedicated modem	port connection.

       TTCCPP     Berkeley	TCP/IP or 3Com UNET  connection.  These	 are  mutually
	       exclusive.   TCP	 ports	do nnoott need entries in _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s since
	       all the necessary information is	contained in _L_._s_y_s.   If  sev-
	       eral  alternate	ports  or network connections should be	tried,
	       use multiple _L_._s_y_s entries.

       _C_l_a_s_s is	usually	the speed (baud) of the	device,	typically  300,	 1200,
       or  2400	 for  ACU devices and 9600 for direct lines.  Valid values are
       device dependent, and are specified in the _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s file.

       On some devices,	the baud may be	 preceded  by  a  non-numeric  prefix.
       This  is	used in	_L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s to distinguish among devices that have iden-
       tical _C_a_l_l_e_r and	baud, but yet are distinctly different.	 For  example,
       1200  could  refer  to  all Bell	212-compatible modems, V1200 to	Racal-
       Vadic modems, and C1200 to CCITT	modems,	all at 1200 baud.

       On TCP connections, _C_l_a_s_s is the	port number (an	integer	number)	 or  a
       port  name  from	_/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s that is used to make the connection. For
       standard	Berkeley TCP/IP, UUCP normally uses port number	540.

       _D_e_v_i_c_e_/_P_h_o_n_e___N_u_m_b_e_r varies based	on the _C_a_l_l_e_r field.  For ACU devices,
       this  is	 the  phone  number to dial.  The number may include: digits 00
       through 99; ## and	** for dialing those symbols on tone telephone lines; --
       (hyphen)	to pause for a moment, typically two to	four seconds; ==	(equal
       sign) to	wait for a second dial tone (implemented as a  pause  on  many
       modems).	Other characters are modem dependent; generally	standard tele-
       phone punctuation characters (such as the slash	and  parentheses)  are
       ignored,	although _u_u_c_i_c_o	does not guarantee this.

       The phone number	can be preceded	by an alphabetic string; the string is
       indexed and converted through the _L_-_d_i_a_l_c_o_d_e_s(5)	file.

       For DIR devices,	the _D_e_v_i_c_e_/_P_h_o_n_e___N_u_m_b_e_r	field contains the name	of the
       device  in  _/_d_e_v	 that  is used to make the connection. There must be a
       corresponding line in  _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s	 with  identical  _C_a_l_l_e_r,  _C_l_a_s_s,  and
       _D_e_v_i_c_e fields.

       For  TCP	 and other network devices, _D_e_v_i_c_e_/_P_h_o_n_e___N_u_m_b_e_r	holds the true
       network name of the remote system, which	may be different from its UUCP
       name (although one would	hope not).

       _E_x_p_e_c_t and _S_e_n_d refer to	an arbitrarily long set	of strings that	alter-
       nately specify what to _e_x_p_e_c_t and what to _s_e_n_d to login to  the	remote
       system once a physical connection has been established.	A complete set
       of expect/send strings is referred to as	an  _e_x_p_e_c_t_/_s_e_n_d	 _s_c_r_i_p_t.   The
       same  syntax  is	used in	the _L_-_d_e_v_i_c_e_s file to interact with the	dialer
       prior to	making a connection; there it is referred to as	a _c_h_a_t _s_c_r_i_p_t.
       The complete format for one _e_x_p_e_c_t_/_s_e_n_d pair is:

	    _e_x_p_e_c_t--_t_i_m_e_o_u_t--_s_e_n_d--_e_x_p_e_c_t--_t_i_m_e_o_u_t	 _s_e_n_d

       _E_x_p_e_c_t  and  _S_e_n_d  are  character  strings.  _E_x_p_e_c_t is compared against
       incoming	text from the remote host; _s_e_n_d	is sent	back  when  _e_x_p_e_c_t  is
       matched.	 By default, the _s_e_n_d is followed by a `\r' (carriage return).
       If the _e_x_p_e_c_t string is not matched  within  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  seconds  (default
       45),  then  it  is  assumed  that  the match failed.  The `_e_x_p_e_c_t--_s_e_n_d--
       _e_x_p_e_c_t' notation	provides a limited loop	mechanism; if the first	_e_x_p_e_c_t
       string  fails  to  match,  then	the _s_e_n_d string	between	the hyphens is
       transmitted, and	_u_u_c_i_c_o waits for the second _e_x_p_e_c_t string. This	can be
       repeated	 indefinitely. When the	last _e_x_p_e_c_t string fails, _u_u_c_i_c_o hangs
       up and logs that	the connection failed.

       The timeout can (optionally) be specified by  appending	the  parameter
       `~~_n_n' to	the expect string, when	_n_n is the timeout time in seconds.

       Backslash  escapes  that	 may be	imbedded in the	_e_x_p_e_c_t or _s_e_n_d strings
       include:

	    \bGenerate a 3/10 second BREAK.
	    \b_nWhere _n is a single-digit number;
	    generate an	_n/10 second BREAK.
	    \cSuppress the \r at the end of a _s_e_n_d string.
	    \dDelay; pause for 1 second. (_S_e_n_d only.)
	    \rCarriage Return.
	    \sSpace.
	    \nNewline.
	    \xxxWhere _x_x_x is an	octal constant;
	    denotes the	corresponding ASCII character.

       As a special case, an empty pair	of  double-quotes  """"  in  the	_e_x_p_e_c_t
       string is interpreted as	``expect nothing''; that is, transmit the _s_e_n_d
       string regardless of what is received. Empty double-quotes in the  _s_e_n_d
       string cause a lone `\r'	(carriage return) to be	sent.

       One of the following keywords may be substituted	for the	_s_e_n_d string:

	    BREAKGenerate a 3/10 second	BREAK
	    BREAK_nGenerate an _n/10 second BREAK
	    CRSend a Carriage Return (same as "").
	    EOTSend an End-Of-Transmission character, ASCII \004.
	    Note that this will	cause most hosts to hang up.
	    NLSend a Newline.
	    PAUSEPause for 3 seconds.
	    PAUSE_nPause	for _n seconds.
	    P_ODDUse odd parity	on future send strings.
	    P_ONEUse parity one	on future send strings.
	    P_EVENUse even parity on future send strings. (Default)
	    P_ZEROUse parity zero on future send strings.

       Finally,	 if  the _e_x_p_e_c_t	string consists	of the keyword AABBOORRTT, then the
       string following	is used	to arm an abort	trap. If that string is	subse-
       quently	received  any  time  prior  to	the  completion	 of the	entire
       _e_x_p_e_c_t_/_s_e_n_d script, then	_u_u_c_i_c_o will abort, just	as if the  script  had
       timed  out. This	is useful for trapping error messages from port	selec-
       tors or front-end processors such as ``Host Unavailable''  or  ``System
       is Down.''

       For example:

	    ""	""  ogin:--ogin:  nuucp	 ssword:  ufeedme

       This  is	executed as, ``When the	remote system answers, _e_x_p_e_c_t nothing.
       _S_e_n_d a carriage return.	_E_x_p_e_c_t	the  remote  to	 transmit  the	string
       `ogin:'.	If it doesn't within 45	seconds, send another carriage return.
       When it finally does, _s_e_n_d it the  string  `nuucp'.   Then  _e_x_p_e_c_t  the
       string `ssword:'; when that is received,	_s_e_n_d `ufeedme'.''

BBUUGGSS
       ``ABORT''  in  the  send/expect script is expressed ``backwards,'' that
       is, it should be	written	`` _e_x_p_e_c_t AABBOORRTT'' but instead it is  ``	 AABBOORRTT
       _e_x_p_e_c_t''.

       Several of the backslash	escapes	in the send/expect strings are confus-
       ing and/or different from those used by	AT&T  and  Honey-Danber	 UUCP.
       For  example,  `\b' requests a BREAK, while practically everywhere else
       `\b' means backspace.  `\t' for tab  and	 `\f'  for  formfeed  are  not
       implemented.  `\s' is a kludge; it would	be more	sensible to be able to
       delimit strings with quotation marks.
