       The  _g_e_t_l_o_a_d_a_v_g	function returns the number of processes in the	system
       run queue averaged over various periods of time.	 Up to	_n_e_l_e_m  samples
       are retrieved and assigned to successive	elements of _l_o_a_d_a_v_g.  The sys-
       tem imposes a maximum of	3 samples, representing	averages over the last
       1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.

       If  the	load  average was unobtainable,	-1 is returned;	otherwise, the
       number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
