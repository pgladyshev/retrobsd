       _Q_s_o_r_t  is  an  implementation of	the quicker-sort algorithm.  The first
       argument	is a pointer to	the base of the	data; the second is the	number
       of elements; the	third is the width of an element in bytes; the last is
       the name	of the comparison routine to  be  called  with	two  arguments
       which  are  pointers  to	the elements being compared.  The routine must
       return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0	 according  as
       the  first argument is to be considered less than, equal	to, or greater
       than the	second.
