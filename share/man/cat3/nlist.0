       _N_l_i_s_t  examines	the  name list in the given executable output file and
       selectively extracts a list of values.  The name	list  consists	of  an
       array  of  structures  containing names,	types and values.  The list is
       terminated with a null name.  Each name is looked up in the  name  list
       of  the file.  If the name is found, the	type and value of the name are
       inserted	in the next two	fields.	  If  the  name	 is  not  found,  both
       entries are set to 0.  See _a_._o_u_t(5) for the structure declaration.

       This  subroutine	 is  useful for	examining the system name list kept in
       the file	//vvmmuunniixx.  In this way programs	can  obtain  system  addresses
       that are	up to date.

       If  the	file  cannot  be  found	or if it is not	a valid	namelist -1 is
       returned;  otherwise,  the  number  of  unfound	namelist  entries   is
       returned.

       The type	entry is set to	0 if the symbol	is not found.
