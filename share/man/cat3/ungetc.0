       _U_n_g_e_t_c  pushes the character _c back on an input stream.	That character
       will be returned	by the next _g_e_t_c call on that stream.  _U_n_g_e_t_c  returns
       _c.

       One  character  of  pushback  is	guaranteed provided something has been
       read from the stream and	the stream is actually buffered.  Attempts  to
       push EOF	are rejected.

       _F_s_e_e_k(3S) erases	all memory of pushed back characters.
