       The  sslleeeepp  function suspends execution of the calling process for _s_e_c_-
       _o_n_d_s of clock time, or until interrupted	by a signal.

       The uusslleeeepp function suspends  execution	of  the	 calling  process  for
       _m_i_c_r_o_s_e_c_o_n_d_s of clock time, or until interrupted	by a signal.

       System activity may lengthen the	suspension.

       The  sslleeeepp  function  returns  0, or if interrupted before _s_e_c_o_n_d_s_, the
       amount not slept	(the requested time minus the time actually slept)  in
       seconds.	 The uusslleeeepp function does not return anything (meaningful).

       Previous	 implementations  of sslleeeepp and uusslleeeepp re-suspended the process
       if interrupted by a signal.  This implementation	has  been  changed  to
       return in that case, to conform to POSIX	1003.1-88.

       On  the PDP-11 the previous version of uusslleeeepp took a _u___i_n_t as the input
       parameter.  This	has been changed to be _l_o_n_g so that uusslleeeepp can be used
       for more	than 65	milliseconds (a	u_int could only count 65535 microsec-
       onds) of	sleep.	Thus it	is now possible	for uusslleeeepp  to	handle	longer
       sleep durations than sslleeeepp.

BBUUGGSS
       On  the	PDP-11	the  clock resolution is limited to the	line frequency
       (usually	60Hz in	the U.S.A. and 50Hz elsewhere).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       A uusslleeeepp	function appeared in 4.3BSD.  A	sslleeeepp function appeared	in V7.
