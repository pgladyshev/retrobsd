DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  ssttrrsseepp()  function locates,	in the string referenced by _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p _,
       the first occurrence of any character in	the string _d_e_l_i_m (or the  ter-
       minating	 `\0' character) and replaces it with a	`\0'.  The location of
       the next	character after	the delimiter character	(or NULL, if  the  end
       of  the string was reached) is stored in	_*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p _.  The	original value
       of _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p is returned.

       An ``empty'' field, i.e.	one caused by two adjacent  delimiter  charac-
       ters,  can  be  detected	 by  comparing	the location referenced	by the
       pointer returned	in _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p to `\0'.

       If _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p is initially	NNUULLLL, ssttrrsseepp() returns NNUULLLL.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The following uses ssttrrsseepp() to parse a string, containing tokens	delim-
       ited by white space, into an argument vector:

       char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;

       for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t")) != NULL;)
	    if (**ap !=	'\0')
		 ++ap;

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       The  ssttrrsseepp()  function	is  intended as	a replacement for the ssttrrttookk()
       function.  While	the ssttrrttookk() function should be	preferred  for	porta-
       bility  reasons	(it conforms to	ANSI C X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'')) it is
       unable to handle	empty fields, i.e.  detect  fields  delimited  by  two
       adjacent	 delimiter  characters,	 or  to	be used	for more than a	single
       string at a time.  The ssttrrsseepp() function	first appeared in 4.4BSD.
