       The  scheduling priority	of the process is augmented by _i_n_c_r.  Positive
       priorities get less service than	normal.	 Priority 10 is	recommended to
       users  who  wish	to execute long-running	programs without flak from the
       administration.

       Negative	increments are ignored except on  behalf  of  the  super-user.
       The priority is limited to the range -20	(most urgent) to 20 (least).

       The priority of a process is passed to a	child process by _f_o_r_k(2).  For
       a privileged process to return  to  normal  priority  from  an  unknown
       state,  _n_i_c_e  should be called successively with	arguments -40 (goes to
       priority	-20 because of truncation), 20 (to get to 0), then 0 (to main-
       tain compatibility with previous	versions of this call).
