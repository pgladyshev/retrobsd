       The  routine  _n_s___a_d_d_r  interprets  character  strings  representing XNS
       addresses, returning binary information	suitable  for  use  in	system
       calls.	_n_s___n_t_o_a	 takes	XNS addresses and returns ASCII	strings	repre-
       senting the address in a	notation in common use in the  Xerox  Develop-
       ment Environment:
	    <network number>.<host number>.<port number>
       Trailing	 zero  fields  are  suppressed,	 and each number is printed in
       hexadecimal, in a format	suitable for input  to	_n_s___a_d_d_r.   Any	fields
       lacking super-decimal digits will have a	trailing ``H'' appended.

       Unfortunately,  no  universal  standard	exists	for  representing  XNS
       addresses.  An effort has been made to insure that _n_s___a_d_d_r be  compati-
       ble with	most formats in	common use.  It	will first separate an address
       into 1 to 3 fields using	a single delimiter chosen from period (``.''),
       colon  (``:'')  or pound-sign (``#'').  Each field is then examined for
       byte separators (colon or period).  If there are	byte separators,  each
       subfield	 separated  is taken to	be a small hexadecimal number, and the
       entirety	is  taken  as  a  network-byte-ordered	quantity  to  be  zero
       extended	in the high-network-order bytes.  Next,	the field is inspected
       for hyphens, in which case the field is assumed to be a number in deci-
       mal  notation with hyphens separating the millenia.  Next, the field is
       assumed to be a number: It is interpreted as hexadecimal	if there is  a
       leading	``0x''	(as in C), a trailing ``H'' (as	in Mesa), or there are
       any super-decimal digits	present.  It is	interpreted as octal is	 there
       is  a leading ``0'' and there are no super-octal	digits.	 Otherwise, it
       is converted as a decimal number.

       The string returned by _n_s___n_t_o_a resides in a static memory area.
       _n_s___a_d_d_r should diagnose improperly formed input,	and there should be an
       unambiguous way to recognize this.
