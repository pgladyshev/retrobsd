       _R_e_x_e_c looks up the host _*_a_h_o_s_t using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N), returning -1 if
       the host	does not exist.	 Otherwise _*_a_h_o_s_t is set to the	standard  name
       of the host.  If	a username and password	are both specified, then these
       are used	to authenticate	to the foreign host; otherwise the environment
       and  then the user's _._n_e_t_r_c file	in his home directory are searched for
       appropriate information.	 If all	this fails, the	user is	 prompted  for
       the information.

       The  port  _i_n_p_o_r_t specifies which well-known DARPA Internet port	to use
       for the connection; the call ``getservbyname("exec", "tcp")'' (see _g_e_t_-
       _s_e_r_v_e_n_t(3N))  will  return a pointer to a structure, which contains the
       necessary port.	The protocol for connection is described in detail  in
       _r_e_x_e_c_d(8C).

       If  the	connection  succeeds,  a socket	in the Internet	domain of type
       SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and given	to the remote  command
       as ssttddiinn	and ssttddoouutt.  If	_f_d_2_p is	non-zero, then an auxiliary channel to
       a control process will be setup,	and a descriptor for it	will be	placed
       in  _*_f_d_2_p.   The	control	process	will return diagnostic output from the
       command (unit 2)	on this	channel, and will also accept  bytes  on  this
       channel	as  being  UNIX	signal numbers,	to be forwarded	to the process
       group of	the command.  The diagnostic  information  returned  does  not
       include	remote	authorization  failure,	as the secondary connection is
       set up after authorization has been verified.  If _f_d_2_p is 0,  then  the
       ssttddeerrrr (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made the same as the ssttdd--
       oouutt and no provision is made  for  sending  arbitrary  signals  to  the
       remote  process,	although you may be able to get	its attention by using
       out-of-band data.
