       _C_r_y_p_t  is the password encryption routine.  It is based on the NBS Data
       Encryption Standard, with variations intended (among other  things)  to
       frustrate use of	hardware implementations of the	DES for	key search.

       The  first  argument to _c_r_y_p_t is	normally a user's typed	password.  The
       second is a 2-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./].   The
       _s_a_l_t string is used to perturb the DES algorithm	in one of 4096 differ-
       ent ways, after which the password  is  used  as	 the  key  to  encrypt
       repeatedly  a  constant	string.	  The  returned	 value	points	to the
       encrypted password, in the same alphabet	as the salt.   The  first  two
       characters are the salt itself.

       The  other  entries provide (rather primitive) access to	the actual DES
       algorithm.  The argument	of _s_e_t_k_e_y is a character array	of  length  64
       containing  only	 the characters	with numerical value 0 and 1.  If this
       string is divided into groups of	8, the low-order bit in	each group  is
       ignored,	leading	to a 56-bit key	which is set into the machine.

       The  argument  to  the  _e_n_c_r_y_p_t	entry is likewise a character array of
       length 64 containing 0's	and 1's.  The argument array  is  modified  in
       place  to  a  similar array representing	the bits of the	argument after
       having been subjected to	the DES	algorithm using	the key	set by _s_e_t_k_e_y_.
       The _e_d_f_l_a_g flag is ignored; the argument	can only be encrypted.

       The  return value points	to static data whose content is	overwritten by
       each call.
