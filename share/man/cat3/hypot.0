       Hypot(x,y)  and	cabs(x,y)  return sqrt(x*x+y*y)	computed in such a way
       that underflow will not happen, and overflow occurs only	if  the	 final
       result deserves it.

       hypot(infinity,v)  = hypot(v,infinity) =	+infinity for all v, including
       _N_a_N.

       Below 0.97 _u_l_ps.	 Consequently hypot(5.0,12.0) =	13.0 exactly; in  gen-
       eral,  hypot  and  cabs	return an integer whenever an integer might be
       expected.

       The same	cannot be said for the shorter and faster version of hypot and
       cabs  that  is provided in the comments in cabs.c; its error can	exceed
       1.2 _u_l_ps.

NNOOTTEESS
       As might	be expected, hypot(v,_N_a_N) and hypot(_N_a_N,v)  are	 _N_a_N  for  all
       _f_i_n_i_t_e  v;  with	"reserved operand" in place of "_N_a_N", the same is true
       on a VAX.  But programmers on machines other than  a  VAX  (it  has  no
       infinity)  might	 be surprised at first to discover that	hypot(+-infin-
       ity,_N_a_N)	 =  +infinity.	 This  is  intentional;	 it  happens   because
       hypot(infinity,v)  =  +infinity	for  _a_l_l v, finite or infinite.	 Hence
       hypot(infinity,v) is independent	of v.  Unlike the reserved operand  on
       a  VAX,	the  IEEE _N_a_N is designed to disappear when it turns out to be
       irrelevant, as it does in hypot(infinity,_N_a_N).
