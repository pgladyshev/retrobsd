       The  ssttrrttoouull() function converts	the string in _n_p_t_r to an _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _l_o_n_g
       value.  The conversion is done according	to the given _b_a_s_e, which  must
       be between 2 and	36 inclusive, or be the	special	value 0.

       The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of	white space (as	deter-
       mined by	isspace(3)) followed by	a single optional `+' or `-' sign.  If
       _b_a_s_e  is	zero or	16, the	string may then	include	a `0x' prefix, and the
       number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero _b_a_s_e is taken	as  10
       (decimal)  unless  the next character is	`0', in	which case it is taken
       as 8 (octal).

       The remainder of	the string is converted	to an _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _l_o_n_g  value  in
       the  obvious  manner, stopping at the end of the	string or at the first
       character that does not produce a valid digit in	the given  base.   (In
       bases above 10, the letter `A' in either	upper or lower case represents
       10, `B' represents 11, and so forth, with `Z' representing 35.)

       If _e_n_d_p_t_r is non	nil, ssttrrttoouull() stores the address of the first invalid
       character  in  _*_e_n_d_p_t_r _.	 If there were no digits at all, however, ssttrr--
       ttoouull() stores the original value	of _n_p_t_r	in _*_e_n_d_p_t_r _.  (Thus, if	 _*_n_p_t_r
       is  not	`\0'  but  _*_*_e_n_d_p_t_r  is	 `\0' on return, the entire string was
       valid.)

       The ssttrrttoouull() function returns either the result	of the conversion  or,
       if  there  was  a leading minus sign, the negation of the result	of the
       conversion, unless the original (non-negated) value would overflow;  in
       the  latter case, ssttrrttoouull() returns UULLOONNGG__MMAAXX and sets the global vari-
       able eerrrrnnoo to EERRAANNGGEE ..

       [ERANGE]	      The given	string was out of range; the  value  converted
		      has been clamped.
