       The  ssttrrffttiimmee(())	function formats the information from _t_i_m_e_p_t_r into the
       buffer _b_u_f according to the string pointed to by	_f_o_r_m_a_t.

       The _f_o_r_m_a_t string consists of zero or  more  conversion	specifications
       and  ordinary  characters.  All ordinary	characters are copied directly
       into the	buffer.	 A conversion specification consists of	a percent sign
       ``%'' and one other character.

       No  more	than _m_a_x_s_i_z_e characters	will be	placed into the	array.	If the
       total number of resulting characters, including	the  terminating  null
       character,  is  not more	than _m_a_x_s_i_z_e, ssttrrffttiimmee(()) returns the number of
       characters in the array,	not counting the terminating null.  Otherwise,
       zero is returned.

       Each  conversion	specification is replaced by the characters as follows
       which are then copied into the buffer.

       %A     is replaced by the full weekday name.

       %a     is replaced by the abbreviated weekday name, where the abbrevia-
	      tion is the first	three characters.

       %B     is replaced by the full month name.

       %b or %h
	      is  replaced  by the abbreviated month name, where the abbrevia-
	      tion is the first	three characters.

       %C     is equivalent to ``%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y''	(the  format  produced
	      by _a_s_c_t_i_m_e(3)).

       %c     is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

       %D     is replaced by the date in the format ``mm/dd/yy''.

       %d     is replaced by the day of	the month as a decimal number (01-31).

       %e     is replaced by the day of	month as a decimal number (1-31); sin-
	      gle digits are preceded by a blank.

       %H     is replaced by the hour (24-hour	clock)	as  a  decimal	number
	      (00-23).

       %I     is  replaced  by	the  hour  (12-hour clock) as a	decimal	number
	      (01-12).

       %j     is replaced  by  the  day	 of  the  year	as  a  decimal	number
	      (001-366).

       %k     is  replaced  by	the  hour  (24-hour clock) as a	decimal	number
	      (0-23); single digits are	preceded by a blank.

       %l     is replaced by the hour (12-hour	clock)	as  a  decimal	number
	      (1-12); single digits are	preceded by a blank.

       %M     is replaced by the minute	as a decimal number (00-59).

       %m     is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).

       %n     is replaced by a newline.

       %p     is replaced by either ``AM'' or ``PM'' as	appropriate.

       %R     is equivalent to ``%H:%M''

       %r     is equivalent to ``%I:%M:%S %p'' .

       %t     is replaced by a tab.

       %S     is replaced by the second	as a decimal number (00-60).

       %T or %X
	      is equivalent to "%H:%M:%S" .

       %U     is  replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first
	      day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

       %W     is replaced by the week number of	the year (Monday as the	 first
	      day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

       %w     is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the	first day of the week)
	      as a decimal number (0-6).

       %x     is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S'' .

       %Y     is replaced by the year with century as a	decimal	number.

       %y     is replaced by the year without  century	as  a  decimal	number
	      (00-99).

       %Z     is replaced by the time zone name.

       %%     is replaced by `%' .
