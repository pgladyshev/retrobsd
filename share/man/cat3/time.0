       _T_i_m_e  returns  the  time	 since 00:00:00	GMT, Jan. 1, 1970, measured in
       seconds.

       If _t_l_o_c is nonnull, the return value is also stored  in	the  place  to
       which _t_l_o_c points.

       The  _f_t_i_m_e  entry  fills	 in a structure	pointed	to by its argument, as
       defined by <_s_y_s_/_t_i_m_e_b_._h>:

       The structure contains the time since the epoch in seconds, up to  1000
       milliseconds of more-precise interval, the local	time zone (measured in
       minutes of time westward	from Greenwich), and a flag that, if  nonzero,
       indicates  that	Daylight Saving	time applies locally during the	appro-
       priate part of the year.
