       Lgamma returns ln|| (x)|.

       The external integer signgam returns the	sign of	| (x) .

       Do nnoott use the expression signgam*exp(lgamma(x))	to compute g :=	| (x).
       Instead use a program like this (in C):
	      lg = lgamma(x); g	= signgam*exp(lg);

       On_ly after lgamma has returned can signgam be correct.  Note  too  that
       | (x)  must overflow when x is large enough, underflow when -x is large
       enough, and spawn a division by zero when x is a	nonpositive integer.

       Only_ in the UNIX	math library for C was the name	gamma ever attached to
       ln| .  Elsewh_ere, for instance in IBM's F_ORTRAN library,	the name GAMMA
       belongs to |  and the name ALGAMA to ln|	 in single precision; in  dou-
       ble the names are DGAMMA	and DLGAMA.  Why should	C be different?

       Archa_eological  records	suggest	 that  C's  gamma originally delivered
       ln(| (|x|)).  Later, the	program	gamma was changed to cope  with	 nega-
       tive  arguments x in a more conventional	way, but the documentation did
       not reflect that	change correctly.  The	most  recent  change  corre_cts
       inaccurate  values  when	x is almost a negative integer,	and lets | (x)
       be computed without conditional expressions.   Programmers  should  not
       assume that lgamma has settled down.

       At  some	 time  in the future, the name _g_a_m_m_a will be rehabilitated and
       used for	the gamma function, just as is done in	FORTRAN.   The	reason
       for  this  is  not  so  much  compatibility with	FORTRAN	as a desire to
       achieve greater speed for smaller values	of |x|	and  greater  accuracy
       for larger values.

       Meanwhile,  programmers	who  have  to use the name _g_a_m_m_a in its	former
       sense, for what is now _l_g_a_m_m_a, have two choices:

       1) Use the old math library, _l_i_b_o_m.

       2) Add the following program to your others:
	  ##iinncclluuddee <<mmaatthh..hh>>
	  ddoouubbllee ggaammmmaa((xx))
	  ddoouubbllee xx;;
	  {{
		 rreettuurrnn	((llggaammmmaa((xx))));;
	  }}

       The reserved operand is returned	on a VAX for  negative	integer	 argu-
       ments, _e_r_r_n_o is set to ERANGE; for very large arguments over/underflows
       will occur inside the _l_g_a_m_m_a routine.
