       _S_i_g_i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t  is	used to	change the system call restart behavior	when a
       system call is interrupted by the specified signal.   If	 the  flag  is
       false  (0), then	system calls will be restarted if they are interrupted
       by the specified	signal and no data has been transferred	 yet.	System
       call restart is the default behavior on 4.2 BSD.

       If  the	flag is	true (1), then restarting of system calls is disabled.
       If a system call	is interrupted by the specified	signal and no data has
       been  transferred,  the	system	call  will return -1 with errno	set to
       EINTR.  Interrupted system calls	that have  started  transferring  data
       will  return  the  amount  of  data  actually transferred.  System call
       interrupt is the	signal behavior	found on 4.1 BSD  and  AT&T  System  V
       UNIX systems.

       Note  that the new 4.2 BSD signal handling semantics are	not altered in
       any other way.  Most notably, signal handlers always  remain  installed
       until explicitly	changed	by a subsequent	_s_i_g_v_e_c(2) call,	and the	signal
       mask operates as	documented in _s_i_g_v_e_c(2).  Programs may switch  between
       restartable and interruptible system call operation as often as desired
       in the execution	of a program.

       Issuing a _s_i_g_i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t(3) call during the execution of a	signal handler
       will  cause  the	 new  action  to  take	place on the next signal to be
       caught.

NNOOTTEESS
       This library routine uses an extension of  the  _s_i_g_v_e_c(2)  system  call
       that  is	 not available in 4.2BSD, hence	it should not be used if back-
       ward compatibility is needed.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       A 0 value indicates that	the call succeeded.  A -1 value	indicates that
       an invalid signal number	has been supplied.
