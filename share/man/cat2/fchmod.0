       The file	whose name is given by _p_a_t_h or referenced by the descriptor _f_d
       has its mode changed to _m_o_d_e.  Modes are	constructed by _o_r'ing together
       some combination	of the following, defined in _<_s_y_s_/_i_n_o_d_e_._h_>:

	      ISUID   04000   set user ID on execution
	      ISGID   02000   set group	ID on execution
	      ISVTX   01000   `sticky bit' (see	below)
	      IREAD   00400   read by owner
	      IWRITE  00200   write by owner
	      IEXEC   00100   execute (search on directory) by owner
		      00070   read, write, execute (search) by group
		      00007   read, write, execute (search) by others

       If  an executable file is set up	for sharing (this is the default) then
       mode ISVTX (the `sticky bit') prevents the system from  abandoning  the
       swap-space  image of the	program-text portion of	the file when its last
       user terminates.	 Ability to  set  this	bit  on	 executable  files  is
       restricted to the super-user.

       If mode ISVTX (the `sticky bit')	is set on a directory, an unprivileged
       user may	not delete or rename files of other users in  that  directory.
       For more	details	of the properties of the sticky	bit, see _s_t_i_c_k_y(8).

       Only the	owner of a file	(or the	super-user) may	change the mode.

       Writing	or  changing the owner of a file turns off the set-user-id and
       set-group-id bits unless	the user is the	super-user.   This  makes  the
       system  somewhat	 more  secure by protecting set-user-id	(set-group-id)
       files from remaining set-user-id	(set-group-id) if they	are  modified,
       at the expense of a degree of compatibility.

       Upon  successful	 completion,  a	 value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

       _C_h_m_o_d will fail and the file mode will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The pathname contains a character	 with  the  high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for a	component of the  path
		      prefix.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The effective user ID does not match the	owner  of  the
		      file and the effective user ID is	not the	super-user.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h  points  outside  the  process's  allocated address
		      space.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system.

       _F_c_h_m_o_d will fail	if:

       [EBADF]	      The descriptor is	not valid.

       [EINVAL]	      _F_d refers	to a socket, not to a file.

       [EROFS]	      The file resides on a read-only file system.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file system.
