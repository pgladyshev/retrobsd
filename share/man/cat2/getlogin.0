DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ggeettllooggiinn routine returns the	login name of the user associated with
       the current session, as previously set by sseettllooggiinn.  The	name  is  nor-
       mally  associated  with a login shell at	the time a session is created,
       and is inherited	by all	processes  descended  from  the	 login	shell.
       (This  is  true even if some of those processes assume another user ID,
       for example when	ssuu(1) is used.)

       SSeettllooggiinn	sets the login name of the user	associated  with  the  current
       session	to  _n_a_m_e.   This  call is restricted to	the super-user,	and is
       normally	used only when a new session is	being created on behalf	of the
       named  user  (for  example,  at	login  time, or	when a remote shell is
       invoked).

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       If a call to ggeettllooggiinn succeeds, it returns a pointer to	a  null-termi-
       nated  string  in  a  static  buffer.  If the name has not been set, it
       returns _N_U_L_L.  If a  call  to  sseettllooggiinn	succeeds,  a  value  of	 0  is
       returned.   If  sseettllooggiinn	 fails,	a value	of -1 is returned and an error
       code is placed in the global location _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
       The following errors may	be returned by these calls:

       EFAULT	      The _n_a_m_e parameter gave an invalid address.

       EINVAL	      The _n_a_m_e parameter pointed to  a	string	that  was  too
		      long.   Login  names  are	 limited  to  _M_A_X_L_O_G_N_A_M_E (from
		      _<_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h_>) characters, currently 16.

       EPERM	      The caller tried to set the login	name and was  not  the
		      super-user.

BBUUGGSS
       Login  names  are limited in length by sseettllooggiinn.	 However, lower	limits
       are placed on login names  elsewhere  in	 the  system  (UT_NAMESIZE  in
       _<_u_t_m_p_._h_>).

       In  earlier  versions of	the system, ggeettllooggiinn failed unless the process
       was associated with  a  login  terminal.	  The  current	implementation
       (using  sseettllooggiinn)  allows getlogin to succeed even when the process has
       no controlling terminal.	 In earlier versions of	the system, the	 value
       returned	by ggeettllooggiinn could not be trusted without checking the user ID.
       Portable	programs should	probably still make this check.
