       The _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n call causes	all or part of a full-duplex connection	on the
       socket associated with _s	to be shut down.  If _h_o_w is  0,	 then  further
       receives	 will  be disallowed.  If _h_o_w is 1, then further sends will be
       disallowed.  If _h_o_w is 2, then further sends and	receives will be  dis-
       allowed.
