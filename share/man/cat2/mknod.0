       _M_k_n_o_d  creates a	new file whose name is _p_a_t_h_.  The mode of the new file
       (including special file bits) is	initialized from _m_o_d_e.	 (The  protec-
       tion  part  of  the  mode  is  modified by the process's	mode mask (see
       _u_m_a_s_k(2))).  The	first block pointer of the i-node is initialized  from
       _d_e_v and is used to specify which	device the special file	refers to.

       If  mode	indicates a block or character special file, _d_e_v is a configu-
       ration dependent	specification of a character or	block I/O device.   If
       _m_o_d_e does not indicate a	block special or character special device, _d_e_v
       is ignored.

       _M_k_n_o_d may be invoked only by the	super-user.

       Upon successful completion a value of  0	 is  returned.	 Otherwise,  a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

       _M_k_n_o_d will fail and the file mode will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      A	component of the path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The process's effective user ID is not super-user.

       [EPERM]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while making the  directory	 entry
		      or allocating the	inode.

       [ENOSPC]	      The  directory  in  which	 the entry for the new node is
		      being placed cannot be  extended	because	 there	is  no
		      space left on the	file system containing the directory.

       [ENOSPC]	      There are	no free	inodes on the file system on which the
		      node is being created.

       [EDQUOT]	      The directory in which the entry for  the	 new  node  is
		      being placed cannot be extended because the user's quota
		      of disk blocks on	the file system	containing the	direc-
		      tory has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]	      The  user's  quota of inodes on the file system on which
		      the node is being	created	has been exhausted.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EEXIST]	      The named	file exists.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h points  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.
