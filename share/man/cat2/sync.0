       _S_y_n_c causes all information in core memory that should be on disk to be
       written out.  This includes modified super  blocks,  modified  i-nodes,
       and delayed block I/O.

       _S_y_n_c should be used by programs that examine a file system, for example
       _f_s_c_k_, _d_f_, etc.  _S_y_n_c is mandatory before	a boot.

       The writing, although  scheduled,  is  not  necessarily	complete  upon
       return from _s_y_n_c.
