       The  ppaatthh argument points to the	pathname of a directory.  The ffdd argu-
       ment is a file descriptor which	references  a  directory.   The	 _c_h_d_i_r
       function	causes this directory to become	the current working directory,
       the starting point for path names not beginning with ``/''.

       The _f_c_h_d_i_r function causes the directory	referenced by ffdd to become the
       current	working	 directory,  the  starting  point for path searches of
       pathnames not beginning with a slahs, '/'.

       In order	for a directory	to become the  current	directory,  a  process
       must have execute (search) access to the	directory.

       Upon  successful	 completion,  a	 value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

EERRRROORRSS
       _C_h_d_i_r will fail and the current working directory will be unchanged  if
       one or more of the following are	true:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 63 characters,	or  an
		      entire path name exceeded	255 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	directory does not exist.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      the pathname.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for  any  component  of  the
		      path name.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h  points  outside  the  process's  allocated address
		      space.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system.

       _F_c_h_d_i_r will fail	and the	current	working	directory will be unchanged if
       one or more of the following are	true:

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for the directory referenced
		      by the file descriptor.

       [ENOTDIR]      The file descriptor ffdd does not reference	a directory.

       [EBADF]	      The argument ffdd is not a valid file descriptor.
