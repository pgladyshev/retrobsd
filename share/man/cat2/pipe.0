       The  _p_i_p_e system	call creates an	I/O mechanism called a pipe.  The file
       descriptors returned can	be used	in read	and  write  operations.	  When
       the  pipe is written using the descriptor _f_i_l_d_e_s[1] up to 4096 bytes of
       data are	buffered before	the writing  process  is  suspended.   A  read
       using the descriptor _f_i_l_d_e_s[0] will pick	up the data.

       It  is assumed that after the pipe has been set up, two (or more) coop-
       erating processes (created by subsequent	_f_o_r_k  calls)  will  pass  data
       through the pipe	with _r_e_a_d and _w_r_i_t_e calls.

       The  shell has a	syntax to set up a linear array	of processes connected
       by pipes.

       Read calls on an	empty pipe (no buffered	data) with only	one  end  (all
       write file descriptors closed) returns an end-of-file.

       Pipes are really	a special case of the _s_o_c_k_e_t_p_a_i_r(2) call and, in fact,
       are implemented as such in the system.

       A signal	is generated if	a write	 on  a	pipe  with  only  one  end  is
       attempted.

       The  function  value zero is returned if	the pipe was created; -1 if an
       error occurred.

EERRRROORRSS
       The _p_i_p_e	call will fail if:

       [EMFILE]	      Too many descriptors are active.

       [ENFILE]	      The system file table is full.

       [EFAULT]	      The _f_i_l_d_e_s buffer	is in an invalid area of the process's
		      address space.

       sh(1), read(2), write(2), fork(2), socketpair(2)

BBUUGGSS
       Should  more  than  4096	bytes be necessary in any pipe among a loop of
       processes, deadlock will	occur.
