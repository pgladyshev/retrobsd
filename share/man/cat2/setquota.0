       Disc  quotas  are  enabled or disabled with the _s_e_t_q_u_o_t_a	call.  _S_p_e_c_i_a_l
       indicates a block special device	on which a mounted file	system exists.
       If  _f_i_l_e	is nonzero, it specifies a file	in that	file system from which
       to take the quotas.  If _f_i_l_e is 0, then quotas are disabled on the file
       system.	 The  quota  file  must	exist; it is normally created with the
       _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k(8) program.

       Only the	super-user may turn quotas on or off.

       A 0 return value	indicates  a  successful  call.	  A  value  of	-1  is
       returned	 when  an error	occurs and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	reason
       for failure.

       _S_e_t_q_u_o_t_a	will fail when one of the following occurs:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of either path prefix	is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      Either pathname contains a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [EINVAL]	      The kernel has not been compiled with the	QUOTA option.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	 component of either pathname exceeded 255 characters,
		      or the entire length of either path name	exceeded  1023
		      characters.

       [ENODEV]	      _S_p_e_c_i_a_l does not exist.

       [ENOENT]	      _F_i_l_e does	not exist.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      either pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The caller is not	the super-user.

       [ENOTBLK]      _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is not a block device.

       [ENXIO]	      The major	device number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is out	of range (this
		      indicates	 no  device  driver  exists for	the associated
		      hardware).

       [EROFS]	      _F_i_l_e resides on a	read-only file system.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for a	 component  of	either
		      path prefix.

       [EACCES]	      _F_i_l_e resides on a	file system different from _s_p_e_c_i_a_l.

       [EACCES]	      _F_i_l_e is not a plain file.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file containing the quotas.

       [EFAULT]	      _S_p_e_c_i_a_l or _p_a_t_h points outside the  process's  allocated
		      address space.

BBUUGGSS
       The  error  codes are in	a state	of disarray; too many errors appear to
       the caller as one value.
