       phys - allow a process to access	physical addresses (2BSD)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  argument  _s_e_g_r_e_g  specifies	a process virtual (data-space) address
       range of	8K bytes starting at virtual address  _s_e_g_r_e_gx8K	 bytes.	  This
       address	range is mapped	into physical address _p_h_y_s_a_d_d_rx64 bytes.  Only
       the first _s_i_z_ex64 bytes of this mapping is  addressable.	  If  _s_i_z_e  is
       zero,  any previous mapping of this virtual address range is nullified.
       For example, the	call

	    phys(7, 1, 0177775);

       will map	virtual	 addresses  0160000-0160077  into  physical  addresses
       017777500-017777577.   In  particular,  virtual	address	0160060	is the
       PDP-11 console located at physical address 017777560.

       This call may only be executed by the super-user.

EERRRROORRSS
       [EPERM]	      The process's effective user ID is not the super-user.

       [EINVAL]	      _S_e_g_r_e_g is	less than 0 or greater than 7.

       [EINVAL]	      _S_i_z_e is less than	0 or greater than 128.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       PDP-11 segmentation hardware

BBUUGGSS
       On systems with ENABLE/34(tm) memory mapping  boards,  _p_h_y_s  cannot  be
       used to map in the I/O page.

       This  system  call is very dangerous.  It is not	considered a permanent
       part of the system.

       _P_h_y_s is unique to the PDP-11 and	2BSD; its use is discouraged.
