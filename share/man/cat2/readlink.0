       _R_e_a_d_l_i_n_k	 places	 the  contents of the symbolic link _n_a_m_e in the	buffer
       _b_u_f_, which has size _b_u_f_s_i_z.  The	contents of the	link are not null ter-
       minated when returned.

       The  call  returns  the	count of characters placed in the buffer if it
       succeeds, or a -1 if an error occurs, placing the  error	 code  in  the
       global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

       _R_e_a_d_l_i_n_k	will fail and the file mode will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EINVAL]	      The named	file is	not a symbolic link.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from the file sys-
		      tem.

       [EFAULT]	      _B_u_f extends  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.
