       The  process group of the specified process is returned by _g_e_t_p_g_r_p_.  If
       _p_i_d is zero, then the call applies to the current process.

       Process groups are used for distribution	of signals, and	 by  terminals
       to  arbitrate  requests	for  their input: processes that have the same
       process group as	the terminal are foreground and	may read, while	others
       will block with a signal	if they	attempt	to read.

       This  call  is  thus  used by programs such as _c_s_h(1) to	create process
       groups in implementing job control.  The	TIOCGPGRP and TIOCSPGRP	 calls
       described  in  _t_t_y(4) are used to get/set the process group of the con-
       trol terminal.
