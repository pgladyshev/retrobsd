       _M_k_d_i_r creates a new directory file with name _p_a_t_h.  The mode of the new
       file is initialized from	_m_o_d_e.  (The protection part  of	 the  mode  is
       modified	by the process's mode mask; see	_u_m_a_s_k(2)).

       The  directory's	 owner	ID  is set to the process's effective user ID.
       The directory's group ID	is set to that	of  the	 parent	 directory  in
       which it	is created.

       The  low-order  9  bits of mode are modified by the process's file mode
       creation	mask: all bits set in the process's file  mode	creation  mask
       are cleared.  See _u_m_a_s_k(2).

       A  0  return  value  indicates success.	A -1 return value indicates an
       error, and an error code	is stored in _e_r_r_n_o_.

       _M_k_d_i_r will fail and no directory	will be	created	if:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The pathname contains a character	 with  the  high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      A	component of the path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for a	component of the  path
		      prefix.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The _p_a_t_h argument	contains a byte	 with  the  high-order
		      bit set.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EEXIST]	      The named	file exists.

       [ENOSPC]	      The  directory  in which the entry for the new directory
		      is being placed cannot be	extended because there	is  no
		      space left on the	file system containing the directory.

       [ENOSPC]	      The  new directory cannot	be created because there there
		      is no space left on the file system  that	 will  contain
		      the directory.

       [ENOSPC]	      There are	no free	inodes on the file system on which the
		      directory	is being created.

       [EDQUOT]	      The directory in which the entry for the	new  directory
		      is  being	 placed	 cannot	be extended because the	user's
		      quota of disk blocks on the file system  containing  the
		      directory	has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]	      The  new	directory cannot be created because the	user's
		      quota of disk blocks on the file system that  will  con-
		      tain the directory has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]	      The  user's  quota of inodes on the file system on which
		      the directory is being created has been exhausted.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while making the  directory	 entry
		      or allocating the	inode.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file system.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h points  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.
