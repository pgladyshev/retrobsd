DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _K_i_l_l sends the signal _s_i_g to a process, specified by the	process	number
       _p_i_d.  _S_i_g may be	one of the signals specified in	_s_i_g_v_e_c(2), or  it  may
       be  0, in which case error checking is performed	but no signal is actu-
       ally sent.  This	can be used to check the validity of _p_i_d.

       The sending and receiving processes must	have the same  effective  user
       ID,  otherwise  this  call  is  restricted to the super-user.  A	single
       exception is the	signal SIGCONT,	 which	may  always  be	 sent  to  any
       descendant of the current process.

       If  the process number is 0, the	signal is sent to all processes	in the
       sender's	process	group; this is a variant of _k_i_l_l_p_g(2).

       If the process number is	-1 and the user	is the super-user, the	signal
       is  broadcast  universally  except  to system processes and the process
       sending the signal.  If the process number is -1	and the	 user  is  not
       the  super-user,	 the  signal is	broadcast universally to all processes
       with the	same uid as the	user except the	process	 sending  the  signal.
       No error	is returned if any process could be signaled.

       For  compatibility with System V, if the	process	number is negative but
       not -1, the signal is sent to all processes whose process group	ID  is
       equal  to  the absolute value of	the process number.  This is a variant
       of _k_i_l_l_p_g(2).

       Processes may send signals to themselves.

       Upon successful completion, a value of 0	 is  returned.	 Otherwise,  a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

EERRRROORRSS
       _K_i_l_l  will  fail	 and  no  signal  will be sent if any of the following
       occur:

       [EINVAL]	      _S_i_g is not a valid signal	number.

       [ESRCH]	      No process can be	found corresponding to that  specified
		      by _p_i_d.

       [ESRCH]	      The  process  id	was given as 0 but the sending process
		      does not have a process group.

       [EPERM]	      The sending process is not the super-user	and its	effec-
		      tive user	id does	not match the effective	user-id	of the
		      receiving	process.  When signaling a process group, this
		      error was	returned if any	members	of the group could not
		      be signaled.
