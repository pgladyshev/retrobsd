       fetchi -	fetch from user	instruction space (2BSD)

       _F_e_t_c_h_i  fetches	the  word at _a_d_d_r from the caller's instruction	space.
       This system call	is required on PDP-11's	with separate instruction  and
       data spaces because the _m_f_p_i instruction	reads from D-space if the cur-
       rent and	previous modes in the program status word are both user.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       Upon successful completion the contents	of  the	 caller's  instruction
       space at	_a_d_d_r are returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is	returned.

EERRRROORRSS
       [EINVAL]	      The  kernel  has	not been compiled for a	processor with
		      separate I/D.

       [EFAULT]	      _A_d_d_r points to an	address	not in the process's allocated
		      instruction space.

BBUUGGSS
       The  error  indication, -1, is a	legitimate function value; _e_r_r_n_o_, (see
       _i_n_t_r_o(2)), can be used to disambiguate.

       _F_e_t_c_h_i is a kludge and exists only to circumvent	 an  alleged  security
       feature on some DEC PDP-11 processors.

       _F_e_t_c_h_i is unique	to the PDP-11 and 2BSD;	its use	is discouraged.
