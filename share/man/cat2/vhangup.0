       _V_h_a_n_g_u_p is used by the initialization process _i_n_i_t(8) (among others) to
       arrange that users are given "clean"' terminals at login,  by  revoking
       access  of  the	previous  users' processes to the terminal.  To	effect
       this, _v_h_a_n_g_u_p searches the system tables	for references to the  control
       terminal	 of  the invoking process, revoking access permissions on each
       instance	of the terminal	that it	finds.	Further	attempts to access the
       terminal	 by  the  affected  processes  will  yield i/o errors (EBADF).
       Finally,	a hangup signal	(SIGHUP) is sent to the	process	group  of  the
       control terminal.

       Access to the control terminal via //ddeevv//ttttyy is still possible.

       This call should	be replaced by an automatic mechanism that takes place
       on process exit.
