       fsync - synchronize a file's in-core state with that on disk

       _F_s_y_n_c  causes  all  modified data and attributes	of _f_d to be moved to a
       permanent storage device.  This normally	results	in all	in-core	 modi-
       fied copies of buffers for the associated file to be written to a disk.

       _F_s_y_n_c  should  be used by programs that require a file to be in a known
       state, for example, in building a simple	transaction facility.

       A 0 value is returned on	success.  A -1 value indicates an error.

EERRRROORRSS
       The _f_s_y_n_c fails if:

       [EBADF]	      _F_d is not	a valid	descriptor.

       [EINVAL]	      _F_d refers	to a socket, not to a file.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system.
