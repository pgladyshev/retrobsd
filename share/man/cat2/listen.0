       To  accept  connections,	 a  socket  is first created with _s_o_c_k_e_t(2), a
       willingness to accept incoming connections and a	queue limit for	incom-
       ing  connections	are specified with _l_i_s_t_e_n(2), and then the connections
       are accepted with _a_c_c_e_p_t(2).  The _l_i_s_t_e_n	call applies only  to  sockets
       of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

       The  _b_a_c_k_l_o_g  parameter defines the maximum length the queue of pending
       connections may grow to.	 If a  connection  request  arrives  with  the
       queue  full the client may receive an error with	an indication of ECON-
       NREFUSED, or, if	the underlying protocol	supports  retransmission,  the
       request may be ignored so that retries may succeed.

       A 0 return value	indicates success; -1 indicates	an error.

       The call	fails if:

       [EBADF]		   The argument	_s is not a valid descriptor.

       [ENOTSOCK]	   The argument	_s is not a socket.

       [EOPNOTSUPP]	   The socket is not of	a type that supports the oper-
			   ation _l_i_s_t_e_n.

       accept(2), connect(2), socket(2)

       The _b_a_c_k_l_o_g is currently	limited	(silently) to 5.
