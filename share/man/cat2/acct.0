NNAAMMEE
       acct - turn accounting on or off

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       aacccctt((ffiillee))
       cchhaarr **ffiillee;;

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The system is prepared to write a record	in an accounting _f_i_l_e for each
       process as it terminates.  This call,  with  a  null-terminated	string
       naming  an  existing file as argument, turns on accounting; records for
       each terminating	process	are appended to	_f_i_l_e.  An argument of 0	causes
       accounting to be	turned off.

       The accounting file format is given in _a_c_c_t(5).

       This call is permitted only to the super-user.

NNOOTTEESS
       Accounting  is automatically disabled when the file system the account-
       ing file	resides	on runs	out of space; it is enabled  when  space  once
       again becomes available.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On error	-1 is returned.	 The file must exist and the call may be exer-
       cised only by the super-user.  It  is  erroneous	 to  try  to  turn  on
       accounting when it is already on.

EERRRROORRSS
       _A_c_c_t will fail if one of	the following is true:

       [EPERM]	      The caller is not	the super-user.

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix, or the path name is not a	regular	file.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EFAULT]	      _F_i_l_e  points  outside  the  process's  allocated address
		      space.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       acct(5),	sa(8)

BBUUGGSS
       No accounting is	produced for programs running when a crash occurs.  In
       particular non-terminating programs are never accounted for.
