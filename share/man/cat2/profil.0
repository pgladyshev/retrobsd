       _B_u_f_f points to an area of core whose length (in bytes) is given by _b_u_f_-
       _s_i_z.  After this	call, the user's program counter (pc) is examined each
       clock tick (VAX and TAHOE: 100 ticks/second = 10	milliseconds per tick;
       60 ticks/second ~= 16 milliseconds per tick); _o_f_f_s_e_t is subtracted from
       it, and the result multiplied by	_s_c_a_l_e.	If the resulting number	corre-
       sponds to a word	inside _b_u_f_f_, that word is incremented.

       The scale is interpreted	as an unsigned,	fixed-point fraction  with  16
       bits  of	fraction: 0xffff gives a 1-1 mapping of	pc's to	words in _b_u_f_f_;
       0x7fff maps each	pair of	instruction words together.

       Profiling is turned off by giving a _s_c_a_l_e of 0 or 1.   It  is  rendered
       ineffective  by	giving a _b_u_f_s_i_z	of 0.  Profiling is turned off when an
       _e_x_e_c_v_e is executed, but remains on in child and	parent	both  after  a
       _f_o_r_k.   Profiling is turned off if an update in _b_u_f_f would cause	a mem-
       ory fault.
