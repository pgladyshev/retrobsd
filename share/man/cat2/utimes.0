       The  _u_t_i_m_e_s  call uses the "accessed" and "updated" times in that order
       from the	_t_v_p vector to set the corresponding recorded times for _f_i_l_e_.

       The caller must be the owner  of	 the  file  or	the  super-user.   The
       "inode-changed" time of the file	is set to the current time.

       Upon  successful	 completion,  a	 value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

       _U_t_i_m_e will fail if one or more of the following are true:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The pathname contains a character	 with  the  high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The  process  is not super-user and not the owner	of the
		      file.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for a	component of the  path
		      prefix.

       [EROFS]	      The  file	 system	 containing  the file is mounted read-
		      only.

       [EFAULT]	      _F_i_l_e or  _t_v_p  points  outside  the  process's  allocated
		      address space.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error  occurred	while  reading	or writing the
		      affected inode.
