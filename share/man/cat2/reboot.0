       _R_e_b_o_o_t reboots the system, and is invoked automatically in the event of
       unrecoverable system failures.  _H_o_w_t_o is	a mask of  options  passed  to
       the  bootstrap program.	The system call	interface permits only RB_HALT
       or RB_AUTOBOOT to be passed to the reboot program; the other flags  are
       used  in	scripts	stored on the console storage media, or	used in	manual
       bootstrap procedures.  When none	of these options (e.g. RB_AUTOBOOT) is
       given,  the system is rebooted from file	"vmunix" in the	root file sys-
       tem of unit 0 of	a disk chosen in a processor specific way.   An	 auto-
       matic consistency check of the disks is then normally performed.

       The bits	of _h_o_w_t_o are:

       RB_HALT
	      the  processor is	simply halted; no reboot takes place.  RB_HALT
	      should be	used with caution.

       RB_ASKNAME
	      Interpreted by the  bootstrap  program  itself,  causing	it  to
	      inquire  as to what file should be booted.  Normally, the	system
	      is booted	from the file "xx(0,0)vmunix" without asking.

       RB_SINGLE
	      Normally,	the reboot procedure involves an automatic  disk  con-
	      sistency	check  and then	multi-user operations.	RB_SINGLE pre-
	      vents the	consistency check, rather simply  booting  the	system
	      with  a  single-user  shell on the console.  RB_SINGLE is	inter-
	      preted by	the _i_n_i_t(8) program in the newly booted	system.	  This
	      switch is	not available from the system call interface.

       Only the	super-user may _r_e_b_o_o_t a	machine.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       If  successful,	this  call never returns.  Otherwise, a	-1 is returned
       and an error is returned	in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
       [EPERM]	      The caller is not	the super-user.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       crash(8), halt(8), init(8), reboot(8)

       The notion of ``console medium'', among other things,  is  specific  to
       the VAX.
