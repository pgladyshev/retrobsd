       _N_o_s_t_k  informs  the  system  that  the process wishes to	manage its own
       stack.  The system releases the stack segment(s)	it has reserved,  mak-
       ing them	available for allocation (via _b_r_k(2)) by the user.

       C  programs  should use _n_o_s_t_k only with great caution and understanding
       of the C	language calling and stack conventions.	 It is most useful for
       assembler programs that want to use the entire available	address	space.

BBUUGGSS
       _N_o_s_t_k is	unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is discouraged.
