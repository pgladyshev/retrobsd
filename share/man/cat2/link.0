       A  hard	link  to _n_a_m_e_1 is created; the link has	the name _n_a_m_e_2.	 _N_a_m_e_1
       must exist.

       With hard links,	both _n_a_m_e_1 and _n_a_m_e_2 must be in	the same file  system.
       Unless  the  caller  is	the super-user,	_n_a_m_e_1 must not be a directory.
       Both the	old and	the new	_l_i_n_k share equal  access  and  rights  to  the
       underlying object.

       Upon  successful	 completion,  a	 value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

       _L_i_n_k will fail and no link will be created if one or more of  the  fol-
       lowing are true:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of either path prefix	is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      Either pathname contains a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of either pathname exceeded 255  characters,
		      or entire	length of either path name exceeded 1023 char-
		      acters.

       [ENOENT]	      A	component of either path prefix	does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      A	component of either path prefix	denies search  permis-
		      sion.

       [EACCES]	      The  requested link requires writing in a	directory with
		      a	mode that denies write permission.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      one of the pathnames.

       [ENOENT]	      The file named by	_n_a_m_e_1 does not exist.

       [EEXIST]	      The link named by	_n_a_m_e_2 does exist.

       [EPERM]	      The file named by	_n_a_m_e_1 is a directory and the effective
		      user ID is not super-user.

       [EXDEV]	      The link named by	_n_a_m_e_2 and the file named by _n_a_m_e_1  are
		      on different file	systems.

       [ENOSPC]	      The  directory  in  which	 the entry for the new link is
		      being placed cannot be  extended	because	 there	is  no
		      space left on the	file system containing the directory.

       [EDQUOT]	      The  directory  in  which	 the entry for the new link is
		      being placed cannot be extended because the user's quota
		      of  disk blocks on the file system containing the	direc-
		      tory has been exhausted.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system to make the directory entry.

       [EROFS]	      The  requested link requires writing in a	directory on a
		      read-only	file system.

       [EFAULT]	      One of the pathnames specified is	outside	the  process's
		      allocated	address	space.
