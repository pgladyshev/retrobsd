       If  the _f_l_a_g argument is	non-zero, the process executing	this call will
       not be swapped unless it	is required to grow.  If the argument is zero,
       the  process is un_l_o_c_ked.  This call may	only be	executed by the	super-
       user.

EERRRROORRSS
       [EPERM]	      The caller is not	the super-user.

BBUUGGSS
       _L_o_c_ked processes	interfere with the compaction of  primary  memory  and
       can  cause  deadlock.   This  system call is not	considered a permanent
       part of the system.

       _L_o_c_k is unique to the PDP-11 and	2BSD; its use is discouraged.
