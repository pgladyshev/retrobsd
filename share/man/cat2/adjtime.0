       _A_d_j_t_i_m_e makes small adjustments to the system time, as returned by _g_e_t_-
       _t_i_m_e_o_f_d_a_y(2), advancing or retarding it by the time  specified  by  the
       timeval	_d_e_l_t_a.	 If  _d_e_l_t_a  is	negative,  the clock is	slowed down by
       incrementing it more slowly than	normal until the  correction  is  com-
       plete.	If  _d_e_l_t_a is positive, a larger	increment than normal is used.
       The skew	used to	perform	the correction is generally a fraction of  one
       percent.	 Thus, the time	is always a monotonically increasing function.
       A time correction from an earlier call to _a_d_j_t_i_m_e may not  be  finished
       when _a_d_j_t_i_m_e is called again.  If _o_l_d_d_e_l_t_a is non-zero, then the	struc-
       ture pointed to will contain, upon return, the number  of  microseconds
       still to	be corrected from the earlier call.

       This  call  may	be used	by time	servers	that synchronize the clocks of
       computers in a local area network.  Such	time servers would  slow  down
       the  clocks of some machines and	speed up the clocks of others to bring
       them to the average network time.

       The call	_a_d_j_t_i_m_e(2) is restricted to the	super-user.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       A return	value of 0 indicates that the call succeeded.  A return	 value
       of  -1 indicates	that an	error occurred,	and in this case an error code
       is stored in the	global variable	_e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
       The following error codes may be	set in _e_r_r_n_o:

       [EFAULT]	      An  argument  points  outside  the  process's  allocated
		      address space.

       [EPERM]	      The  process's  effective	 user  ID  is  not that	of the
		      super-user.

       _A_d_j_t_i_m_e(2)  calls  are executed immediately, not	over a period of time,
       therefore, the _o_l_d_d_e_l_t_a return  values  for  an	_a_d_j_t_i_m_e(2)  call  will
       always be zero.
