       The  _q_u_o_t_a  call	manipulates disk quotas	for file systems that have had
       quotas enabled with _s_e_t_q_u_o_t_a(2).	 The _c_m_d parameter indicates a command
       to  be  applied to the user ID _u_i_d.  _A_r_g	is a command specific argument
       and _a_d_d_r	is the address of an optional, command specific,  data	struc-
       ture that is copied in or out of	the system.  The interpretation	of _a_r_g
       and _a_d_d_r	is given with each command below.

       Q_SETDLIM
	      Set disc quota limits and	current	usage for  the	user  with  ID
	      _u_i_d.   _A_r_g  is a major-minor device indicating a particular file
	      system.  _A_d_d_r is a pointer to a struct dqblk structure  (defined
	      in <_s_y_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h>).  This call is restricted to the super-user.

       Q_GETDLIM
	      Get  disc	 quota	limits	and current usage for the user with ID
	      _u_i_d.  The	remaining parameters are as for	Q_SETDLIM.

       Q_SETDUSE
	      Set disc usage limits for	the user with ID _u_i_d.  _A_r_g is a	major-
	      minor  device  indicating	 a  particular file system.  _A_d_d_r is a
	      pointer	to   a	 struct	  dqusage   structure	(defined    in
	      <_s_y_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h>).  This call is restricted to the super-user.

       Q_SYNC Update  the  on-disc copy	of quota usages.  _A_r_g is a major-minor
	      device indicating	the file system	to be  sync'ed.	  If  the  _a_r_g
	      parameter	is specified as	NODEV, all file	systems	that have disc
	      quotas will  be  sync'ed.	  The  _u_i_d  and	 _a_d_d_r  parameters  are
	      ignored.

       Q_SETUID
	      Change  the  calling process's quota limits to those of the user
	      with ID _u_i_d.  The	_a_r_g and	_a_d_d_r  parameters  are  ignored.	  This
	      call is restricted to the	super-user.

       Q_SETWARN
	      Alter  the  disc	usage warning limits for the user with ID _u_i_d.
	      _A_r_g is a major-minor device indicating a particular file system.
	      _A_d_d_r  is	a  pointer  to	a  struct dqwarn structure (defined in
	      <_s_y_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h>).  This call is restricted to the super-user.

       Q_DOWARN
	      Warn the user with user ID _u_i_d about excessive disc usage.  This
	      call  causes the system to check its current disc	usage informa-
	      tion and print a message on the terminal of the caller for  each
	      file  system  on	which  the user	is over	quota.	If the user is
	      under quota, his warning count is	reset to  MAX_*_WARN  (defined
	      in  <_s_y_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h>).  If the _a_r_g parameter	is specified as	NODEV,
	      all file systems that have disc quotas will be checked.	Other-
	      wise, _a_r_g	indicates a specific major-minor device	to be checked.
	      This call	is restricted to the super-user.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       A successful call returns 0, otherwise the value	-1 is returned and the
       global variable _e_r_r_n_o indicates the reason for the failure.

EERRRROORRSS
       A _q_u_o_t_a call will fail when one of the following	occurs:

       [EINVAL]	      The kernel has not been compiled with the	QUOTA option.

       [EINVAL]	      _C_m_d is invalid.

       [ESRCH]	      No disc quota is found for the indicated user.

       [EPERM]	      The  call	 is  priviledged  and  the  caller was not the
		      super-user.

       [ENODEV]	      The _a_r_g parameter	is being interpreted as	a  major-minor
		      device and it indicates an unmounted file	system.

       [EFAULT]	      An  invalid  _a_d_d_r	 is supplied; the associated structure
		      could not	be copied in or	out of the kernel.

       [EUSERS]	      The quota	table is full.

BBUUGGSS
       There should be some way	to integrate this call with the	resource limit
       interface provided by _s_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2) and _g_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2).

       The Australian spelling of _d_i_s_k is used throughout the quota facilities
       in honor	of the implementors.
