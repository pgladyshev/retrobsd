       _U_n_l_i_n_k removes the entry	for the	file _p_a_t_h from its directory.  If this
       entry was the last link to the file, and	no process has the file	 open,
       then  all  resources  associated	with the file are reclaimed.  If, how-
       ever, the file was open in any process, the actual resource reclamation
       is delayed until	it is closed, even though the directory	entry has dis-
       appeared.

       Upon successful completion, a value of 0	 is  returned.	 Otherwise,  a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate the	error.

       The _u_n_l_i_n_k succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       [EACCES]	      Write permission is denied on the	 directory  containing
		      the link to be removed.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The named	file is	a directory and	the effective user  ID
		      of the process is	not the	super-user.

       [EPERM]	      The  directory containing	the file is marked sticky, and
		      neither the containing directory	nor  the  file	to  be
		      removed are owned	by the effective user ID.

       [EBUSY]	      The  entry  to  be  unlinked  is	the  mount point for a
		      mounted file system.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while deleting the directory entry
		      or deallocating the inode.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h  points  outside  the  process's  allocated address
		      space.
