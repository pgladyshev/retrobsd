       _T_r_u_n_c_a_t_e	 causes	the file named by _p_a_t_h or referenced by	_f_d to be trun-
       cated to	at most	_l_e_n_g_t_h bytes in	size.	If  the	 file  previously  was
       larger  than  this  size,  the extra data is lost.  With	_f_t_r_u_n_c_a_t_e, the
       file must be open for writing.

       A value of 0 is returned	if the call succeeds.  If the call fails a  -1
       is returned, and	the global variable _e_r_r_n_o specifies the	error.

       _T_r_u_n_c_a_t_e	succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       [EACCES]	      The named	file is	not writable by	the user.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EISDIR]	      The named	file is	a directory.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [ETXTBSY]      The  file	is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is
		      being executed.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred updating the inode.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h points  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.

       _F_t_r_u_n_c_a_t_e succeeds unless:

       [EBADF]	      The _f_d is	not a valid descriptor.

       [EINVAL]	      The _f_d references	a socket, not a	file.

       [EINVAL]	      The _f_d is	not open for writing.

       These calls should be generalized to allow ranges of bytes in a file to
       be discarded.
