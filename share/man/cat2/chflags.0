       The file	whose name is given by ppaatthh or referenced by the descriptor ffdd
       has its flags changed to	ffllaaggss ..

       The flags specified are formed by or'ing	the following values

       UF_NODUMP      Do not dump the file.

       UF_IMMUTABLE   The file may not be changed.

       UF_APPEND      The file may only	be appended to.

       ARCHIVED	      File is archived.

       SF_IMMUTABLE   The file may not be changed.

       SF_APPEND      The file may only	be appended to.

       The UUFF__IIMMMMUUTTAABBLLEE	and UUFF__AAPPPPEENNDD flags may	be set or unset	by either  the
       owner of	a file or the super-user.

       The  SSFF__IIMMMMUUTTAABBLLEE  and  SSFF__AAPPPPEENNDD flags may only	be set or unset	by the
       super-user.  They may be	set at any time,  but  normally	 may  only  be
       unset  when  the	 system	 is  in	 single-user  mode.   (See _i_n_i_t_(_8_) for
       details.)

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0	is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
       returned	and the	global variable	eerrrrnnoo is set to	indicate the error.

       Chflags will fail if:

       ENOTDIR	      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       EINVAL	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       ENAMETOOLONG   A	component of a pathname	exceeded 63 characters,	or  an
		      entire path name exceeded	255 characters.

       ENOENT	      The named	file does not exist.

       EACCES	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       ELOOP	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       EPERM	      The  effective  user  ID does not	match the owner	of the
		      file and the effective user ID is	not the	super-user.

       EROFS	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       EFAULT	      ppaatthh points  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.

       EIO	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file system.

       fchflags	will fail if:

       EBADF	      The descriptor is	not valid.

       EINVAL	      ffdd refers	to a socket, not to a file.

       EPERM	      The effective user ID does not match the	owner  of  the
		      file and the effective user ID is	not the	super-user.

       EROFS	      The file resides on a read-only file system.

       EIO	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
