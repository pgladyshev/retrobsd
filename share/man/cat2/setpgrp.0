       _S_e_t_p_g_r_p	sets  the  process  group  of the specified process _p_i_d	to the
       specified _p_g_r_p.	If _p_i_d is zero,	then the call applies to  the  current
       process.

       If  the	invoker	 is not	the super-user,	then the affected process must
       have the	same effective user-id as the invoker or be  a	descendant  of
       the invoking process.

       _S_e_t_p_g_r_p	returns	 when  the  operation  was successful.	If the request
       failed, -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o indicates the rea-
       son.

EERRRROORRSS
       _S_e_t_p_g_r_p	will  fail and the process group will not be altered if	one of
       the following occur:

       [ESRCH]	      The requested process does not exist.

       [EPERM]	      The effective user ID of the requested process  is  dif-
		      ferent  from that	of the caller and the process is not a
		      descendent of the	calling	process.
