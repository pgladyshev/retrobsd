       _U_m_a_s_k  sets the process's file mode creation mask to _n_u_m_a_s_k and returns
       the previous value of the mask.	The low-order 9	 bits  of  _n_u_m_a_s_k  are
       used  whenever  a  file	is created, clearing corresponding bits	in the
       file mode (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)).  This clearing	allows each user  to  restrict
       the default access to his files.

       The  value is initially 022 (write access for owner only).  The mask is
       inherited by child processes.

       The previous value of the file mode mask	is returned by the call.
