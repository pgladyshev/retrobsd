       _K_i_l_l_p_g  sends  the signal _s_i_g to	the process group _p_g_r_p.	 See _s_i_g_v_e_c(2)
       for a list of signals.

       The sending process and members of the process group must have the same
       effective  user	ID, or the sender must be the super-user.  As a	single
       special case the	continue signal	SIGCONT	may be	sent  to  any  process
       that is a descendant of the current process.

       Upon  successful	 completion,  a	 value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of	-1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is	set  to	 indi-
       cate the	error.

EERRRROORRSS
       _K_i_l_l_p_g  will  fail  and	no signal will be sent if any of the following
       occur:

       [EINVAL]	      _S_i_g is not a valid signal	number.

       [ESRCH]	      No process can be	found in the process  group  specified
		      by _p_g_r_p.

       [ESRCH]	      The process group	was given as 0 but the sending process
		      does not have a process group.

       [EPERM]	      The sending process is not the  super-user  and  one  or
		      more  of	the  target processes has an effective user ID
		      different	from that of the sending process.
