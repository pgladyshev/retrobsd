       _D_i_r_n_a_m_e	is the address of the pathname of a directory, terminated by a
       null byte.  _C_h_r_o_o_t causes this directory	to become the root  directory,
       the starting point for path names beginning with	``/''.

       In  order  for  a directory to become the root directory	a process must
       have execute (search) access to the directory.

       This call is restricted to the super-user.

       Upon successful completion, a value of 0	 is  returned.	 Otherwise,  a
       value of	-1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set	to indicate an error.

       _C_h_r_o_o_t  will  fail  and	the root directory will	be unchanged if	one or
       more of the following are true:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path name is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The pathname contains a character	 with  the  high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	directory does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search permission	is denied for  any  component  of  the
		      path name.

       [ELOOP]	      Too  many	symbolic links were encountered	in translating
		      the pathname.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h points  outside  the	 process's  allocated  address
		      space.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file system.
