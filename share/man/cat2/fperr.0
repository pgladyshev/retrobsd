       _F_p_e_r_r returns the contents of the floating-point	processor's error reg-
       isters as they were following the last floating exception generated  by
       the calling process.  The registers are stored in the structure pointed
       to by _f_p_e.

       This call is required because the error registers in the	PDP-11	float-
       ing-point  processor  are read-only.  Thus, they	may be changed by some
       other process between the time that the current	process	 generates  an
       exception  and  the  time  that it reads	the registers.	Therefore, the
       system saves their state	at the time of an exception.

       The values returned are valid only after	a floating-point exception.

EERRRROORRSS
       [EINVAL]	      The kernel has not been compiled for  a  processor  with
		      floating point.

       _F_p_e_r_r is	unique to the PDP-11 and 2BSD; its use is discouraged.
