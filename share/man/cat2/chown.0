       The  file  that	is named by _p_a_t_h or referenced by _f_d has its _o_w_n_e_r and
       _g_r_o_u_p changed as	specified.  Only the super-user	may change  the	 owner
       of  the file, because if	users were able	to give	files away, they could
       defeat the file-space accounting	procedures.  The owner of the file may
       change the group	to a group of which he is a member.

       On  some	systems, _c_h_o_w_n clears the set-user-id and set-group-id bits on
       the file	to prevent accidental creation of set-user-id and set-group-id
       programs.

       _F_c_h_o_w_n  is  particularly	 useful	when used in conjunction with the file
       locking primitives (see _f_l_o_c_k(2)).

       One of the owner	or group id's may be left unchanged by	specifying  it
       as -1.

       If  the	final  component of _p_a_t_h is a symbolic link, the ownership and
       group of	the symbolic link is changed, not the ownership	and  group  of
       the file	or directory to	which it points.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       Zero  is	returned if the	operation was successful; -1 is	returned if an
       error occurs, with a more specific  error  code	being  placed  in  the
       global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
       _C_h_o_w_n will fail and the file will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]      A	component of the path prefix is	not a directory.

       [EINVAL]	      The  pathname  contains  a character with	the high-order
		      bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG] A	component of a pathname	exceeded 255 characters, or an
		      entire path name exceeded	1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]	      The named	file does not exist.

       [EACCES]	      Search  permission is denied for a component of the path
		      prefix.

       [ELOOP]	      Too many symbolic	links were encountered in  translating
		      the pathname.

       [EPERM]	      The effective user ID is not the super-user.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EFAULT]	      _P_a_t_h  points  outside  the  process's  allocated address
		      space.

       [EIO]	      An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing  to
		      the file system.

       _F_c_h_o_w_n will fail	if:

       [EBADF]	      _F_d does not refer	to a valid descriptor.

       [EINVAL]	      _F_d refers	to a socket, not a file.

       [EPERM]	      The effective user ID is not the super-user.

       [EROFS]	      The named	file resides on	a read-only file system.

       [EIO]	      An  I/O  error occurred while reading from or writing to
		      the file system.
