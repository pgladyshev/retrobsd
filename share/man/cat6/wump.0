       _W_u_m_p  plays the game of `Hunt the Wumpus.'  A Wumpus is a creature that
       lives in	a cave with several rooms connected by	tunnels.   You	wander
       among  the  rooms,  trying to shoot the Wumpus with an arrow, meanwhile
       avoiding	being eaten by the Wumpus and falling  into  Bottomless	 Pits.
       There  are also Super Bats which	are likely to pick you up and drop you
       in some random room.

       The program asks	various	questions which	you answer one	per  line;  it
       will give a more	detailed description if	you want.

       This program is based on	one described in _P_e_o_p_l_e_'_s _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r _C_o_m_p_a_n_y_, _2_,
       2 (November 1973).
