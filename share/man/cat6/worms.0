       Brian  Horn  (cithep!bdh)  showed  me a _T_O_P_S_-_2_0 program on the DEC-2136
       machine called _W_O_R_M, and	suggested that I write a similar program  that
       would run under _U_n_i_x.  I	did, and no apologies.

       --ffiieelldd  makes a "field" for the worm(s) to eat; --ttrraaiill causes each worm
       to leave	a trail	behind it.  You	can figure out the rest	by yourself.
