       _R_o_g_u_e  is a computer fantasy game with a	new twist.  It is crt oriented
       and the object of the game is to	survive	the attacks  of	 various  mon-
       sters and get a lot of gold, rather than	the puzzle solving orientation
       of most computer	fantasy	games.

       To get started you really only need to know two commands.  The  command
       ??   will	 give  you  a list of the available commands and the command //
       will identify the things	you see	on the screen.

       To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to	 beat  other  people's
       high  scores)  you  must	locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere
       below the 20th level of	the  dungeon  and  get	it  out.   Nobody  has
       achieved	 this  yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in
       history as a hero among heroes.

       When the	game ends, either by your death, when you quit,	or if you  (by
       some  miracle) manage to	win, _r_o_g_u_e will	give you a list	of the top-ten
       scorers.	 The scoring is	based entirely upon how	 much  gold  you  get.
       There is	a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

       If  _s_a_v_e___f_i_l_e  is  specified, rogue will	be restored from the specified
       saved game file.	 If the	--rr option is used, the save game file is  pre-
       sumed to	be the default.

       The --ss option will print	out the	list of	scores.

       The --dd option will kill you and try to add you to the score file.

       For more	detailed directions, read the document _A _G_u_i_d_e _t_o _t_h_e _D_u_n_g_e_o_n_s

       Probably	 infinite  (although  countably	 infinite).  However, that Ice
       Monsters	sometimes transfix you permanently is _n_o_t a bug.  It's a  fea-
       ture.
