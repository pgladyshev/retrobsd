       _Q_u_i_z  gives  associative  knowledge tests on various subjects.  It asks
       items chosen from _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_1 and expects answers from _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_2.  If  no
       categories  are specified, _q_u_i_z gives instructions and lists the avail‐
       able categories.

       _Q_u_i_z tells a correct answer whenever you type a bare newline.   At  the
       end of input, upon interrupt, or when questions run out, _q_u_i_z reports a
       score and terminates.

       The --tt flag specifies  `tutorial'  mode,  where  missed  questions  are
       repeated later, and material is gradually introduced as you learn.

       The  --ii  flag  causes  the named file to be substituted for the default
       index file.  The lines of these files have the  syntax:
              line      = category newline ⎪ category `:' line
              category  = alternate ⎪ category `|' alternate
              alternate = empty ⎪ alternate primary
              primary   = character ⎪ `[' category `]' ⎪ option
              option    = `{' category `}'

       The first category on each line of an index file names  an  information
       file.   The  remaining categories specify the order and contents of the
       data in each line of the information file.  Information files have  the
       same  syntax.   Backslash  `\' is used as with _s_h(1) to quote syntacti‐
       cally significant characters or to insert transparent newlines  into  a
       line.  When either a question or its answer is empty, _q_u_i_z will refrain
       from asking it.

       The construct `a|ab' doesn't work in an information file.  Use `a{b}'.
