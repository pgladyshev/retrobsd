       _B_a_n_n_e_r  prints a	large, high quality banner on the standard output.  If
       the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads	one line of its	 stan-
       dard  input.  If	--ww is given, the output	is scrunched down from a width
       of 132 to _n _, suitable for a narrow terminal.   If  _n  is  omitted,  it
       defaults	to 80.

       The  output  should be printed on a hard-copy device, up	to 132 columns
       wide, with no breaks between the	pages. The volume is great enough that
       you  may	 want  a  printer  or a	fast hardcopy terminal,	but if you are
       patient,	a decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.

BBUUGGSS
       Several ASCII characters	are not	defined, notably <, >, [, ], \,	^,  _,
       {,  },  |,  and	~.  Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny looking
       (but in a useful	way.)

       The --ww option is	implemented by skipping	some rows  and	columns.   The
       smaller	it  gets,  the grainier	the output.  Sometimes it runs letters
       together.
