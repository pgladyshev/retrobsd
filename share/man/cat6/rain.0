       _R_a_i_n's  display	is modeled after the VAX/VMS program of	the same name.
       The terminal has	to be set for 9600 baud	to obtain the proper effect.

       As with all programs that use _t_e_r_m_c_a_p, the  TERM	 environment  variable
       must be set (and	exported) to the type of the terminal being used.
