       _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c  types  out  simple  arithmetic  problems,  and waits	for an
       answer to be typed in.	If  the	 answer	 is  correct,  it  types  back
       "Right!",  and  a  new  problem.	  If  the  answer is wrong, it replies
       "What?",	and waits for another answer.  After every twenty problems, it
       publishes statistics on correctness and the time	required to answer.

       To quit the program, type an interrupt (delete).

       The first optional argument determines the kind of problem to be	gener-
       ated; ++--xx// respectively cause  addition,	 subtraction,  multiplication,
       and  division  problems to be generated.	 One or	more characters	can be
       given; if more than one is given, the different types of	problems  will
       be mixed	in random order; default is ++--..

       _R_a_n_g_e  is a decimal number; all addends,	subtrahends, differences, mul-
       tiplicands, divisors, and quotients will	be less	than or	equal  to  the
       value of	_r_a_n_g_e.	Default	_r_a_n_g_e is 10.

       At  the	start,	all  numbers  less  than or equal to _r_a_n_g_e are equally
       likely to appear.  If the respondent makes a mistake,  the  numbers  in
       the problem which was missed become more	likely to reappear.

       As  a  matter of	educational philosophy,	the program will not give cor-
       rect answers, since the learner should, in principle, be	able to	calcu-
       late  them.   Thus the program is intended to provide drill for someone
       just past the first learning stage, not to teach	number facts _d_e	 _n_o_v_o.
       For  almost  all	users, the relevant statistic should be	time per prob-
       lem, not	percent	correct.
