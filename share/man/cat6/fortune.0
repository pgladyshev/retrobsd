       _F_o_r_t_u_n_e with no arguments prints	out a random adage. The	flags mean:

       --ww   Waits before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
	    number of characters in the	message.  This is useful if it is exe-
	    cuted  as  part of the logout procedure to guarantee that the mes-
	    sage can be	read before the	screen is cleared.

       --ss   Short messages only.

       --ll   Long messages only.

       --oo   Choose from	an alternate list of adages,  often  used  for	poten-
	    tially offensive ones.

       --aa   Choose from	either list of adages.
