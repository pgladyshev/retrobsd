       The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal	Cave, find the
       treasures hidden	there, and bring them back to the building  with  you.
       The  program is self-descriptive	to a point, but	part of	the game is to
       discover	its rules.

       To terminate a game, type `quit'; to save a game	for later  resumption,
       type `suspend'.

BBUUGGSS
       Saving  a  game	creates	 a  large  executable file instead of just the
       information needed to resume the	game.
